\chapter{Defeasible Reasoning}
\label{chapter:defeasible-reasoning}

The study of logical systems which violate monotonicity has recieved significant attention. Largely, the motivation for violating monotonicity is
that it can be beneficial to make more credulous inferences. Frequently, we are required to make decisions without perfect knowledge of the
environment. If, in light of new information, we are able to change our minds, then the decision making process displays non-monotonic behaviour.

This work is interested in one particular style of non-monotonic reasoning developed by Kraus, Lehamnn, and Magidor
\shortcite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what}, frequently referred to by its initialisation as the \textit{KLM framework}.

\section{Background on Non-monotonic Reasoning}
\label{section:nmr-background}

Near the end of the previous chapter, the matter of consequence was discussed in a very formal sense. It is perhaps helpful to distinguish the formal
treatment of consequence from its colloquial use, as the former yields some surprising results which do not appear at all congruent with how a
person, or otherwise intelligent agent should reason \cite{tarski1936consequence,kraus1990nonmonotonic}. As a demonstration of a result, which may be
surprising in this way, consider the following propositions which state that \textit{humans experience chronological time, soldiers are human}, and
that \textit{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\texttt{human}\rightarrow \texttt{chronological time}$

	\item $\texttt{soldier}\rightarrow \texttt{human}$

	\item $\texttt{Billy Pilgrim}\rightarrow \neg \texttt{chronological time}$
\end{enumerate}

Knowing these propositions, if one were to encounter an individual who were a soldier then it would seem appropriate, by propositions 1 and 2, to
deduce that the individual's experience of time was chronological. Suppose that after some conversation, it was learned that the individual's name
was Billy Pilgrim. In light of this, one should retract the previous inference and instead deduce that the individual's experience of time were in
fact non-chronological.

If one were using some classical system, such as propositional logic, such recourse would not be possible. On first encounter with the individual,
the set of valuations which are consistent with the prior knowledge, alongside the recognition that the individual were a soldier, is reduced to the
single model: $\,\{\overline{b}, c, h, s\}\,$. ($b,c,h,s$ represent \textit{Billy Pilgrim, chronological time, human,} and \textit{soldier},
respectively). When it is later learned that the individual is Billy Pilgrim, the previous valuation is no longer consistent with what we know. In
fact, there is no model of our knowledge, and our theory becomes unsatisfiable. By the principle of explosion, our theory now entails everything,
including that the individual experiences time both chronologically and non-chronologically. Indeed, in telling us that everything follows, such
theories tell us nothing.

This property---that adding new information can never result in retraction of prior knowledge---is called monotonicity. The presence of monotonicity
prevents one from making inferences that we are not absolutely certain of. Intuitively, this means we may not infer anything that does not hold in
all the possible worlds, relative to what we already know. In other words, only infer that which is true in every model of our current knowledge. If
we remain in the classical realm, it seems our only options are to abandon our original claim or risk explosion.

At this point it is a good idea to provide some early intuitions on how one might violate monotonicity in a reasonable way. Continuing with the
example, it is reasonable to suggest that typically we think think that humans expereince time chronologically. In order to reconcile the information
that Billy Pilgrim is a human who experiences non-chronological time, it could be that he is simply an a-typical human.

In the proceeding section, these ideas will be explored in a more formal manner. The idea observed by Shoham \shortcite{shohamSemanticApproach}, that
we may ``bend the rules'' of logical consequence and restrict consideration to priveleged subsets of valuations deemed `preferable` is foundational
to this kind of reasoning.

% To make the previous paragraph more formal, we remind the reader of the
% discussion held around \Cref{definition:logical-consequence}: A formula
% $\phi$ is a logical consequence of a set $\Gamma$ thereof if every model
% of $\Gamma$ is also a model of $\phi$. Put differently, there is no
% valuation (or, possible world) where $\Gamma$ is true and $\phi$ is
% false. It follows directly that $\phi$ remains a logical consequence of
% $\Gamma \cup \{\,\psi\,\}$, since $\Gamma$ is true in any world where
% $\Gamma \cup \{\,\psi\,\}$ is true. It was pointed out in
% \cite{shohamSemanticApproach} that we may \say{bend the rules} and
% restrict semantic consideration to a privileged subset of models deemed
% ``preferable''. We call these selected models the \textit{minimal
% models}---the reasons for this name should become clearer as the chapter
% progresses.

\section{Preferential Reasoning and the KLM Framework}
\label{section:klm-framework}

The KLM framework for non-monotonic reasoning was initially described by a collection of consequence relations satisfying certain axioms, frequently
called the \textit{rationality postulates}. These axioms describe a reasonable account of non-monotonic consequence. We borrow a nice story from Dov
Gabbay \shortcite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}, in which he motivates why consequence relations are a good starting point for the study of
non-monotonic systems.

Paraphrasing, the reader to imagine a machine that is supposed to do some kind of non-monotonic inference. The machine maps meaningful expressions of
knowledge onto formulae, and so queries of the form \say{Does $\phi$ follow (non-monotonically) from $\psi$?}. Something goes awry (suppose some
coffee was spilled), calling into question whether the logic of the machine still functions correctly. Even worse, the interface, which provides the
mapping between formulae and which concrete pieces of knowledge they represent, is destroyed. Consequently, if the machine functions correctly cannot
be determined based on its output since the meaning represented by each formula cannot be ascertainted. How might one then evaluate the machine's
function? If we were interested in classical consequence, we would be well-equipped to assess the correctness of the machine by determining if it
satisfied reflexivity, monotonicity, and cut (we point to \Cref{definition:consequence-relations} as a reminder). In other words, to study the more
abstract properties of consequence.

This is precisely the starting point that Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor took up in \shortcite{kraus1990nonmonotonic}, suggesting that before getting to
the semantics of a non-monotonic system, it is a good idea to axiomatise the system as a consequence relation satisfying certain properties. The
rationality postulates are precisely this axiomatisation, characterising a sensible pattern of reasoning for non-monotonic systems. The symbol
`$\twiddle$' (pronounced ``twiddle'') is used instead of `$\vdash$' to denote a non-monotonic consequence relation. As may be expected, $\phi
	\twiddle \psi$ has the same meaning as $(\phi, \psi) \in \; \twiddle$, and $\phi \ntwiddle \psi$ as $(\phi , \psi)\not \in \; \twiddle$. At times of
potential confusion, a subscript may be sued to disambiguate which consequence relation is being referred to, and so $\twiddle_{p}$ would refer to a
preferential relation, as defined below.

\subsection{Preferential Consequence Relations}
\label{subsection:system-P} \index{non-monotonic reasoning! system P}

We begin the exposition of the KLM framework by looking at \textit{preferential consequence}, or \textit{system P}.
\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferential-relation}

	The consequence relation $\twiddle$ is a \emph{preferential consequence relation} if and only if it satisfies the properties of \emph{Reflexivity},
	\emph{Left Logical Equivalence}, \emph{Right Weakening}, \emph{And}, \emph{Or}, and \emph{Cautious Monotony}.
\end{definition}

We represent each property, or postulate, of preferential relations in a style analogous to inference rules. The intended meaning is that, if all
statements above the line are included in the relation, then the statement below must also be included.

\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:ref}
	\inferLeft{Reflexivity}{}{\phi \twiddle \phi}
\end{align}

The first axiom, \textit{Reflexivity}, is largely self justifying. It makes little sense to speak about a notion of consequence that does not satisfy
this property. Such systems are discussed in \Cref{subsection:association-rules}, although we are reluctant to call them ``logical''.

\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:lle}
	\inferLeft{Left Logical Equivalence}{\vdash \phi \leftrightarrow \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma}{\psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

The justification for \textit{Left Logical Equivalence} is a bit more opaque. The principle it describes is that if two scenarios represent the same
state of affairs, and in one of these scenarios it we typically expect some consequence, then we should expect the same in the other scenario.
\textcolor{red}{Invariant to substitution of logically equivalent formulas?}

\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:rw}
	\inferLeft{Right Weakning}{\vdash \psi \rightarrow \gamma, \quad \phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Right Weakening} allows the preservation of classical consequence within preferential logic. It says that, if from $\phi$ we normally expect $\psi$, but from $\psi$ we \textit{always}
see $\gamma$, then we are entitled to think that from $\phi$ we normally expect $\gamma$ as well.

\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:or}
	\inferLeft{Or}{\phi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \lor \psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

As a justification for \textit{Or}, consider that \textit{Normally, if Billy were abducted by aliens he would be traumatised}, but also
\textit{Normally, if Billy witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden he would be traumatised}. If we learned that either of these events took place, we
should find it plausible to infer that Billy were traumatised.

\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:and}
	\inferLeft{And}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \psi \land \gamma}
\end{align}

The \textit{And} postulate suggests that if $\psi$ and $\gamma$ are both expected consequence of $\phi$, then their conjunction is also expected.
This postulate fails in probabilistic systems, such as \textit{association rules} \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}.

\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:cm}
	\inferLeft{Cautious Monotony}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma }{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Cautious Monotony} (which has also be called \textit{Cumulative Monotony} by \cite{makinson2003bridges}, and \textit{Restricted Monotony} by \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}) corresponds
to the notion that if we are in an epistemic state $\phi$ where one expectation, among others, is that $\psi$ holds. Learning that $\psi$ indeed holds should not alter the epistemic state in
such a way that the \textit{other} expectations are abandoned, and so the new state, $\phi \land \psi$, we should expect everything that was expected when all we knew was $\phi$. In other words,
we reason monotonically with respect to expected information.

The above postulates capture the essence of preferential (consequence) relations. Much like we saw with Hilbert systems, however, certain rules,
which reveal interesting properties of system P, may be derived. A version of \textit{Cut}:
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:cut}
	\inferLeft{Cut}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
The original version due to Gentzen \cite{Ben1993Mathematical}, which is
presented as:
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Monotonic Cut}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \alpha \twiddle \psi}{\phi \land \alpha \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
implies monotonicity, as it requires that if $\psi$ is a typical
consequence of $\alpha$, then it must remain a consequence of $\alpha
	\land \phi$: ergo, monotonicity. The former variation does not enforce
this, and rather says \say{Suppose I have certain knowledge of $\phi$, and
	that if I were to assume $\psi$ I should expect to conclude $\gamma$. Then
	if I can show that infact $\psi$ was already an expected consequence of
	knowing $\phi$, I should expect that $\gamma$ follows from $\phi$}. When
considered alongside the argument for Cautious Monotony, Cut seems
obviously acceptable.

The rule $S$, which is analogous to one half of the deduction theorem (cf. \Cref{axiom:deduction-theorem}), expresses the notion that we retain
plausible inferences when conditioned on a hypothesis.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{S}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \psi \rightarrow \gamma}
\end{align}

The following Lemma is a helpful intuition pump: it suggests that we can use the consequences of plausible inferences to make further plausible
inferences.
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:cut-cautious}

	We can cover the properties of \emph{cut} and \emph{cautious monotonicity} with the following principle: \say{If $\phi \twiddle \psi$, then the
		typical consequences of $\phi$ and $\phi \land \psi$ coincide}.
\end{lemma}

% \begin{align} \label{postulate:monotonicity}\inferLeft{Monotonicity}{\psi
% \rightarrow \gamma, \quad \gamma \twiddle \phi}{\psi \twiddle \phi}
% \end{align} % In addition, \textit{Transitivity} and
% \textit{Contraposition} both imply monotonicity when considered alongside
% the other rules of cumulative relations % \begin{align}
% \label{postulate:trans}\inferLeft{Transitivity}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad
% \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \gamma} \end{align}

% \begin{align} \label{postulate:contra}\inferLeft{Contraposition}{\phi
% \twiddle \psi}{\neg \psi \twiddle \neg \phi} \end{align}

% These properties are undesirable as they imply monotonicity.
It is, however, worth reminding ourselves of the goal that was set out at the start of this chapter: To formalise a system which facilitates a more
credulous style of reasoning. That is, we are interested in making \textit{more} inferences than can be made under classical notions of consequence.
One property which has not been discussed is whether the proposed system be \textit{supraclassical} \cite{makinson2003bridges}.
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:supraclassical}
	\inferLeft{Supraclassical}{\phi \rightarrow \psi}{\phi \twiddle \psi}
\end{align}
Supraclassicality is the question of whether classical inferences be
preserved in a non-classical system. Defeasible inferences are useful in
that they can be made despite the existence of exceptions. When there are
no exceptions, we should be able to maintain the validity of classical
reasoning.
\subsubsection{Preferential Interpretations}
\label{subsubsection:preferential-interpretations}

The semantics for preferential relations, provided by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor \shortcite{kraus1990nonmonotonic}, are based on the
\textit{preference logics} introduced by Shoham \shortcite{shohamSemanticApproach}. The fundamental idea is that valuations, or \textit{worlds}, can
be ordered by a \textit{preference relation} so that one world being preferred to another is the normative claim that we should consider deductions
which hold in the preferred world as more plausible than those made from the other.

It will be useful to recall some definitions from propositional logic: a valuation $u \in \mathcal{U}$ is a \textit{model} of a formula $\phi \in
	\mathcal{L}$ if it satisfies $\phi$, $\phi$ is \textit{satisfiable} if it has a model. Another formula $\psi$ is a \textit{logical consequence} of
$\phi$ if the models of $\phi$ are a subset of the models of $\psi$.

We now introduce analogous definitions in the setting of preferential logic. The first change is that we consider a richer language, $\Lang$. This is
$\lang$ extended with the new connective `$\twiddle$' such that $\phi \twiddle \psi$ is a sentence in $\Lang$ when $\phi, \psi \in \mathcal{L}$. It
is easy to skip over, but usage of the `$\twiddle$' has now shifted from an element of the metalanguage, where it refers to a kind of consequence
relation, to an object level connective, used somewhat analogously to the classical Boolean operator `$\rightarrow$'. Certain restrictions on the
usage of `$\twiddle$' do apply. In particular, the nesting of defeasible statements is not permitted, and so $\phi \twiddle (\psi \twiddle \gamma )$
is not a statement in the language $\Lang$. At times, we may wish to distinguish between formulae in $\Lang$ which do not use `$\twiddle$', and so we
refer to these as classical, and the alternative as defeasible formulae.

Defeasible conditionals may be satisfied by a \textit{preferential interpretation}, which is a structure defined as:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferential-interpretation}
	\index{non-monotonic reasoning! system P! preferential interpretation}

	A \emph{preferential interpretation} $\Pin$ is a triple where $S$ is a set of \emph{states}, $l: S \to \mathcal{U}$ is a function mapping states to
	valuations, and $\prec$ is a strict partial-order on $S$.
\end{definition}

The preference relation provides a basis for restricting ourselves to consider only those preferred worlds, which represent a normal state of
affairs. This idea is formalised as \textit{minimal states}:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:state-minimal}

	Given a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ and some $\phi \in \Lang$, we write $\underline{\hat{\phi}}$ to denote the set $\{\,s \in \hat{\phi}\mid
		\nexists s ' \in \hat{\phi}\text{ such that }s' \prec s \,\}$, which is the set of \textit{preferred states} that satisfy $\phi$. We may also call
	these the \textit{$\phi$-minimal} states.
\end{definition}

It is necessary to stress the distinction between states in a preferential interpretation and valuations. There is no requirement that the mapping
from states to valuations be injective, and so the same valuation may appear many times in the preference relation under distinct states. A corollary
is that, given a finite set of valuations, the set of states may be infinite. In turn, the preference relation of a preferential interpretation is
required to satisfy the \textit{smoothness} condition (which has also been called \textit{boundedness} in \cite{shohamSemanticApproach}, or
\textit{stoppering} \cite{makinson2003bridges}):

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:smoothness}
	\index{binary relation! smoothness}

	A preferential interpretation $\Pin$ is called \textit{smooth} if and only if for each $\phi \in \Lang$, and each state $s \in \hat{\phi}$ satisfying
	$\phi$, either $s \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$ or there exists another state $s' \in \hat{\phi}$ where $s' \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$.
\end{definition}

The smoothness condition is violated by preference relations which fail to satisfy transitivity, or where there are infinite descending chains of
more preferred states \cite{Schlechta1996}. The consequence relations of preferential interpretations with non-smooth preference relations may fail
to satisfy cautious monotony \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,makinson2003bridges}. \textcolor{red}{give a demonstration of why}

Although it causes no confusion, there are distinct formulations of what it means for a preferential interpretation to satisfy a classical versus a
defeasible formula. For the classical case, we have the following:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:state-satisfaction}

	Given a preferential interpretation $\pin$, we say that a state $s \in S$ \emph{satisfies} a classical formula $\phi \in \Lang$ if and only if the
	valuation $l(s) \vDash \phi$. In this case, we write $\pin, s \vDash \phi$, and use $\hat{\phi}$ to denote the set $\{\,s \in S \mid \pin,s \vDash
		\phi \,\}$. Then, $\pin$ \textit{satisfies} $\phi$ if and only if $\pin , s \vDash \phi$ for all $s \in S$.
\end{definition}

What it means for a preferential interpretation to satisfy a classical formula is unsurprising, and corresponds to the idea that the formula holds in
every possible world. We are more interested in what it means for defeasible formulae to be satisfied, and so we have:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferentially-satisfiable}

	A defeasible formula $\phi \twiddle \psi \in \Lang$ is \emph{satisfied} by a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ if and only if the every minimal
	state $s \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$ also satisfies $\psi$. In this case we write $\pin \VDash \phi \twiddle \psi$ and say that $\pin$ is a
	\emph{preferential model} of $\phi \twiddle \psi$.
\end{definition}

One pleasing perspective on the semantics of preferential consequence relations is that we require little in the way of ``new machinery''. Outside of
the preference relation, satisfaction of a defeasible conditional behaves similarly to satisfaction of classical formulae, only with a restricted
consideration on states.

\begin{example}
	\label{example:preferential-interpretation}

	Consider the knowledge base
	\[
		\Delta = \{\,\, h \twiddle c,\; s \twiddle h, \; b \rightarrow \neg c \, \,\}
	\]
	which contains both defeasible conditionals, as well as classical propositional formulae. The knowledge base encodes the setting where \say{Normally,
		humans experience time chronologically}, \say{Normally, soldiers are human}, and \say{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time.}

	\Cref{figure:preferential-interpretation} represents a preferential model of $\Delta$. The line diagrams contained in the figure represent all the necessary information required to determine
	which are the minimal states satisfying each proposition.

	As a means of providing some intution for \Cref{lemma:cut-cautious}, which says that ``If $\phi \twiddle \psi$ then the plausible consequences of $\phi$ and $\phi \land \psi$ coincide'', we

\begin{theorem}[Soundness]
	\label{theorem:soundness-preferential}

	If $\Pin$ is a preferential interpretation and $\phi, \psi \in \Lang$, then $\pin$ defines the consequence relation $\twiddle_{\pin}$ given by the
	set $\{\,\phi \twiddle_{\pin}\psi \mid \pin \VDash \phi \twiddle \psi\,\}$, which satisfies \textit{Reflexivity}, \textit{Left Logical Equivalence},
	\textit{Right Weakening}, \textit{Or}, and \textit{Cautious Monotony} and is thus a preferential consequence relation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
	\label{theorem:completeness-preferential}

	If $\twiddle_{P}$ is a preferential consequence relation, then there exists a preferential interpretation $W$ which induces the consequence relation
	$\twiddle_{W}$ such that $\twiddle_{P}$ is precisely $\twiddle_{W}$.
\end{theorem}

The decision to construct the preference relation on states which map to valuations, rather than valuations directly, may seem arbitrary. Certainly,
Shoham \shortcite{shohamSemanticApproach} makes no such distinction in his preferential logic. However, Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor
\shortcite{kraus1990nonmonotonic} provide an example, apty described as ``en pessant'' by \cite{Bezzazi1997}, which shows that it is necessary. The
example considers a preferential consequence relation generated by a preferential interpretation where the function mapping states to valuations is
not injective. It is then shown that there is no other preferential interpretation with an injective mapping with an equivalent consequence relation.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:states-preferential}

	There exists a non-injective preferential interpretation $\pin$ which defines the consequence relation $\twiddle_{\pin}$ such that no injective
	preferential interpretation defines the same consequence relation.
\end{lemma}

\Cref{figure:duplicate-states-example} shows a portion of the preferential interpretation in \Cref{example:preferential-interpretation}. The states $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are duplicate states,
specifically they both map to the valuation $\{\,s,h,\overline{c}\,\}$. As before, this prefrential interpretation is a model of $s \twiddle h$ as the set of minimal $s$-states, $\{\,s_{2},s_{3}
	\,\}$, is a subset of the $h$-states.

% Consider the more finely grained portion of the preferential
% interpretation in \Cref{figure:preferential-interpretation}. As before,
% the interpretation is a model of the conditional $s \twiddle h$. It is
% not, however, a model of $s \twiddle c$ given that $s_{2}$, a duplicate
% state to $s_{1}$, is a minimal state satisfying $s$ which does not
% satisfy $c$.

The preferential interpretation in \Cref{figure:duplicate-states-example} is not a model of $s \twiddle c$, due to the counter example of $s_{2}$,
which is a minimal $s$-state that does not satisfy $c$. Should the duplicate states be merged into $s_{12}$, so that now $s_{3}\prec s_{12}$ and
$s_{4}\prec s_{12}$, then $s \twiddle c$ would be satisfied, since $s_{12}$ is no longer an $s$-minimal state.

\subsection{Preferential Entailment}
\label{subsection:preferential-entailment}

Equipped with definitions for the class of preferential relations and a representation theorem that relates these to a corresponding semantics
derived from preferential interpretations, it is appropriate to discuss the matter of \textit{preferential entailment}.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:p-entailment}

	A defeasible knowledge base $\Delta$ \textit{preferentially entails} a defeasible conditional $\phi \in \Lang$ if and only if $\phi$ is satisfied by
	every preferential model of $\Delta$, in this case we write $\Delta \pentails \phi$. The set of all defeasible conditionals that can be
	preferentially entailed from $\Delta$ is denoted by $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$ and is called the \textit{preferential closure} of $\Delta$.
\end{definition}

The structure of preferential entailment should be quite familiar. It is a Tarskian notion of consequence where, just as in the classical case,
entailment from a set is determined by checking all models of the set. The difference is that in this case, models are preferential interpretations,
rather than classical valuations. The preferential closure of $\Delta$ is the set of all expressions that every model of $\Delta$ ``agrees'' should
hold. By \Cref{theorem:soundness-preferential}, each preferential model $\pin$ induces a corresponding preferenital consequence relation. From the
perspective of preferential relations, entailment can be regarded as taking the intersection of the preference relations induced by the models of
$\Delta$. We formalise this below.

\begin{corollary}
	\label{corollary:preferential-entailemnt-relations}
	Let $\Delta$ be a defeasible knowledge base over $\Lang$, $\phi \twiddle \psi$ a defeasible statement in the same language, and $\mathfrak{W}$
	be the set of all preferential relations induced by models of $\Delta$. Then, $\Delta \pentails \phi \twiddle \psi$ if and only if $\phi \twiddle \psi \in \bigcap \mathfrak{W}$.
\end{corollary}

We abuse notation here, and use $\twiddle$ to mean the object-level connective, as well as to denote a preferential consequence relation. It does not
cause any issue, as the connective $\phi \twiddle \psi$ is satisfied by a preferential model $\pin$ if and only if it is in the preferential relation
induced by $\pin$.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem:preferential-entailment-postulates}

	Let $\Delta \pentails \phi$, then there is a proof from $\Delta$ to $\phi$ derived by application of \Crefrange{postulate:ref}{postulate:cm}.
\end{theorem}

Nonetheless, $\phi \twiddle \psi$ is preferentially entailed by $\Delta$ if all the preferential models ``agree'' that $\phi \twiddle \psi$ holds.
Each preferential model $\pin$ induces a corresponding preferential consequence relation $\twiddle_{\pin}$; and so, preferential entailment may be
considered, from the perspective of consequence relations, to be the intersection of all preferential relations which correspond to models of
$\Delta$.

The definition provided for preferential entailment is worryingly similar to the Tarskian idea of logical consequence, described in
\Cref{subsection:logical-consequence}. It is only ``worrying'' insofar as Tarskian consequence is monotonic, and we are interested in non-monotonic
entailment relations. Indeed, this concern is justified: If we consider the set of preferential models of a defeasible knowledge base $\Delta$, then
the set of conditionals they all agree on is exactly the preferential closure, $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$. The addition of another conditional to our knowledge
base, resulting in $\Delta \cup \{\,\, \delta \,\,\}$, only serves to reduce consideration to those preferential models of $\Delta$ that also satisfy
$\phi$. Within this restricted set of models, the consensus on $\Cn{p}(\Delta )$ remains. Formally, we have:
\begin{align}
	\Delta \subseteq \Delta \cup \{\,\delta\,\} \quad \textit{implies}\quad \Cn{p}(\Delta) \subseteq \Cn{p}(\Delta \cup \{\, \delta \,\}).
\end{align}

There is room for (justified) confusion at this point. Preferential reasoning was initially described as providing a non-monotonic counterpart to
material implications, and yet has also just been described as monotonic. Indeed, on the object-level preferential reasoning still displays
non-monotonic behaviour, and so $\texttt{soldier}\twiddle \texttt{human}$ does not necessarily imply that $\texttt{soldier}\land
	\texttt{chronological}\twiddle \texttt{human}$.

There is room for some (justified) confusion here. After all, we have carefully avoided satisfying otherwise useful properties because they imply
monotonicity, only to end up with precisely that. To clarify this, we recognise that a system can display non-monotonic behaviour in different areas.
Indeed the entailment relation of system P---which reasons on the metalevel---is monotonic, while the object level expresses non-monotonic behaviour,
facilitating the expression of statements like \textit{Normally Humans experience chronological time}, \textit{Billy Pilgrim is a Human},
\textit{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time}.

There are arguments, in fact we make one in \textcolor{red}{chapter:defeasible-reasoning-in-fca}, which suggest that object level non-monotonicity is
sufficient.

% \begin{theorem} \label{theorem:preferential-compactness} If $\phi$ is a
% singular, and $\Delta$ a set of defeasible conditionals in $\Lang$, then
% the following equivalency holds: \begin{enumerate} \item The set $\Delta$
% p-entails $\phi$; or, $\Delta \dentails_{p}\phi$

% \item There is a finite sequence consisting of the properties satisfied
% by preferential relations from $\Delta$ to $\phi$. \end{enumerate}
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{corollary} \label{corollary:monotonocity-preferential-entailment}
% The preferential closure $\Delta^{p}$ of a set $\Delta$ of defeasible
% conditionals is a preferential consequence relation, and therefore has a
% preferential model $\pin$ that satisfies exactly every statement in
% $\Delta^{p}$. \end{corollary}

% precisely because they may be retracted we may withdraw previous

\subsection{Rational Consequence Relations}
\label{subsection:rational-consequence-relations}

System P provides a characterisation, in the form of its postulates, of a particular style of non-monotonic reasoning. There are other kinds of
reasoning, not valid in system P, for which there are good reasons think of as reasonable properties of non-monotonic reasoning
\cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what}.

\textit{Negation Rationality} suggests that our defeasible inferences should withstand piercing the veil of ignorance. Suppose Alice is a university student, if she holds the belief that \textit{Normally,
	she will pass her exams}, then it would not be reasonable for her to simultaneously think \textit{Normally, if she studies, she will not pass her exams} and also \textit{Normally, if she does
	not study, she will not pass her exams}.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Negation Rationality}{\phi \land \psi \ntwiddle \gamma, \quad \phi \land \neg \psi \ntwiddle \gamma}{\phi \ntwiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
Either Alice studies or she does not. If, in either case, she will not pass her exams, then it is difficult to comprehend how it might be normal for her to pass her exams.

\textit{Disjunctive Rationality} says that a plausible inference made from a disjunction should be plausible from at least one of the disjuncts.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Disjunctive Rationality}{\phi \ntwiddle \gamma, \quad \psi \ntwiddle \gamma}{\phi \lor \psi \ntwiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Rational monotony} is a much stronger form of restricted monotony than cautious monotony. Where cautious monotony holds the position that we should only reason monotonically with the
addition of new information that was already expected given our beliefs, rational monotony suggests that we should reason monotonically with the addition of new information if it is merely
\textit{consistent} with existing beliefs; that is, we did not expect the negation of the new information.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Rational Monotony}{\phi \land \psi \ntwiddle \gamma, \quad \phi \ntwiddle \neg \psi }{\phi \ntwiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

Rational monotony can be equivalently stated as the following, which makes the intuition a bit clearer.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Rational Monotony}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \ntwiddle \neg \gamma}{\phi \land \gamma \twiddle \psi}
\end{align}

At a university, it might be normal for students to graduate. At the same time, it would be too great a requirement to suggest that it is normal for
students to be exceptionally clever. It seems completely appropriate to maintain our belief that it is normal for students, who are not exceptionally
clever, to graduate.

Stalnaker \cite{Stalnaker1994,sep-logic-nonmonotonic-Stanford}, and separately Ginsberg \shortcite{GinsberCounterfactuals}, provide an argument
against accepting rational monotony. The objection is that rational monotony commits us to make inferences when the more reasonable position is to
remain undecided. Paraphrasing, we are asked to consider three composers: \textit{Verdi}, who is believed to be Italian, and \textit{Satie} and
\textit{Bizet}, who are believed to be French. If it were learned that Verdi and Bizet were compatriots, then it seems reasonable that the conclusion
that either of them are French or Italian is indeterminate. What is reasonable, however, is to maintain the belief that Satie is French.\footnote{We
	will use some syntax from predicate logic, this is merely an aid to make Stalnaker's example clearer.}
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}
The argument proceeds by considering that Verdi and Satie may too be compatriots. Since Verdi's nationality is now unknown, we are no longer equipped to reject the plausibility of the new
compatriotship, and so
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\ntwiddle \neg \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie)}
\end{align}
The two conditions of rational monotony have been met, and so the following inference should continue to hold
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\land \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie)}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}

The issue, as Stalnaker sees it, is that rational monotony forces the inference Satie is still French, and by their compatriotship, so are Bizet and
Verdi. The ``correct'' thing to do in this scenario is to remain uncertain about which nationality they all share.

However, the result Stalnaker objects to is dependent his particular construction of this problem, rather than being intrinsic to rational monotony.
The second condition for rational monotony, that $\phi \ntwiddle \neg \gamma$, makes no requirement about the syntactic structure of $\gamma$ outside
of it being a formula in the language. In the example, Stalnaker could just as easily have written
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet,Verdi)}\ntwiddle \neg (\neg \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie))}
\end{align}
meaning that it is not expected that Verdi and Satie are compatriots, to which we can apply an instance of rational monotony, from which we are not forced to believe that all three composers
are French.
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\land \neg(\texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie))}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}

There is another objection to rational monotony, which will be considered later on. For now, we accept it as a valid property of non-monotonic
reasoning, and thus introduce \textit{rational relations}.
\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:rational-relation}

	The consequence relation $\twiddle$ is a \emph{rational consequence relation} if and only if it satisfies the properties of \emph{Reflexivity},
	\emph{Left Logical Equivalence}, \emph{Right Weakening}, \emph{And}, \emph{Or}, \emph{Cautious Monotony}, and \emph{Rational Monotony}.
\end{definition}

Quite evidently, they are a particular kind of preferential relation.

\subsubsection{Ranked Interpretations}
\label{subsubsection:ranked-interpretations}

From the knowledge that rational relations are a particular kind of preferential relation, it seems a reasonable jump to think that the semantics we
give to rational relations may be a particular kind of preferential interpretation. Before discussing this jump, a useful exercise is to recognise
how preferential interpretations may fail to satisfy rational monotony.

Consider the two preferential interpretations shown in \Cref{figure:two-preferential-models}, which model the scenario which was discussed in the
example near the end of the last subsection.

\begin{example}
	\label{example:university}

	Suppose that neither Alice nor Bob is a clever student. In spite of her status, Alice is considered by the preference relation to be a normal
	student, alongside Charlie. This situation is modelled in each of the preferential interpretations below.

			\subcaption{Modular preference relation} \label{subfigure:rational}
		\end{minipage}
		\caption{ Two preferential models of the above scenario}
		\label{figure:two-preferential-models}
	\end{figure}

	We may verify that both are models of $\texttt{student}\twiddle \texttt{graduate }$, and neither are models of $\texttt{student}\twiddle
		\texttt{clever}$. By rational monotony, we should expect that $\texttt{student}\land \neg \texttt{clever}\twiddle \texttt{graduate}$ be satisfied,
	which is not the case in \Cref{subfigure:not-rational}.
\end{example}
Fortunately, the culprit is quite easy to spot. Bob, who is not under
consideration in the context of normal students, appears when we discuss
normal students who are not clever. In isolation, this seems acceptable:
if all the normal students were also clever, then we would be fine
accepting the appearance of a normal, non-clever student who was not a
normal student. However, we have explicitly ruled out this line of
argument---by the second antecedent of rational monotony---as Alice is a
normal student who is also not clever.

In order to ensure rational monotony, it is required that the preference relation commit to Alice being preferred to Bob; more generally, all normal
students should be explicitly preferred to non-normal students. This notion is formalised by the following property called \textit{modualarity}:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:modular-order}
	\index{partial-order! modular}

	A partial order $\prec$ on the set $X$ is \emph{modular} if and only if for any incomparable $x,y \in X$ when $z \prec x$ then also $z \prec y$.
\end{definition}

One perspective on \textit{modular} partial orders is that they partition the set of states into equivalence classes of preference, so that all
states in the same class are incomparable to one another \cite{GinsberCounterfactuals}. Then, if the preference relation is defined as the
equivalence relation itself, such that one state is preferred to another if the class it belongs to is preferred to the other's, we get a modular
order.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:ranked-interpretation}

	A \emph{ranked interpretation} is a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ where the preference relation $\prec$ is \emph{modular}.
\end{definition}

A somewhat superficial result of ranked interpretations is that they admit a new representation as a stratified equivalence relation, depicted in
\Cref{figure:ranked-interpretation-representation}. Each strata, or \textit{rank}, has an associated ordinal.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:modular-ranking-function}

	If $\prec$ is a modular partial order on $X$ then there is a \emph{ranking function} $\mathsf{r}\colon X \to \Omega$, with $\Omega$ being a totally
	ordered set for which the strict order is denoted $<$, such that if $x \prec y$ then $\mathsf{r}(x) < \mathsf{r}(y)$ for any $x,y \in X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={circle, fill=black, inner sep=0.5pt, minimum size=1.5mm}]
		\draw[rounded corners=10pt, line width=0.1mm] (0,2) rectangle (4,0);
		\draw[rounded corners=10pt, line width=0.1mm] (0,1) -- (4,1);
		\node[fill=none] (0) at (0.5,0.5) [] {$0$};
		\node[fill=none] (1) at (0.5,1.5) [] {$1$};
		\draw (1,0) -- (1,2);
		\node[fill=none] (alice) at (1.8,0.5) [] {$\{\,c,g,s\,\}$};
		\node[fill=none] (charlie) at (3,0.5) [] {$\{\,g,s\,\}$};
		\node[fill=none] (bob) at (2.5,1.5) [] {$\{\,c,s\,\}$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{A depiction of a ranked interpretation}
	\label{figure:ranked-interpretation-representation}
\end{figure}

A second, less superficial, departure is that \Cref{lemma:states-preferential} does not hold in the context of ranked interpretations and rational
consequence relations. This follows directly from modularity, as the en pessant style arguments, discussed earlier, are avoided by modularity. This
allows the elements which populate the ranks of a ranked interpretation to be valuations directly, rather than states.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:ranked-interpretation-real}

	A \emph{ranked interpretation} is a function $\mathsf{r}\colon \mathcal{U}\to \mathbb{N}$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Ranked Entailment}
\label{subsection:ranked-entailment}

\subsection{Rational Closure}
\label{subsection:rational-closure}

Within the context of preferential models, there is another treatment of classical formulae which allows for the discarding of
\Cref{definition:state-satisfaction} and a single notion of what it means for a preferential interpretation to be a model of a formula in $\Lang$.
The idea is to translate the hard-constraints of classical formulae to defeasible syntax.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:classical-to-defeasible}

	If $\phi$ is a classical formula in the language $\Lang$, then it can be expressed as the defeasible conditional $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$. Then, any
	preferential interpretation $\pin$ is a model of $\phi$ if and only if it is a model of the defeasible conditional $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$.
\end{lemma}

To explain the mechanics behind \Cref{lemma:classical-to-defeasible}, consider that a preferential interpretation $\pin$ being a model of the
conditional $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$ is equivalent to the $\neg \phi$-minimal states being a subset of the states which satisfy $\bot$. Of course,
$\bot$ represents logical falshood, and the set of states which satisfy it is the emptyset. In turn, if $\pin$ is a model of $\neg \phi \twiddle
	\bot$, there can be no states which satisfy $\neg \phi$, which is equivalent to the condition that all states satisfy $\phi$. If $\phi$ is thought of
as the proposition \say{All men are mortal}, then the defeasible counterpart reads as \say{If not all men are mortal, then it is normal to infer
	anything, including a contradiction} \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what}.

We assume this treatment of classical formulae from this point onwards, and consolidate the notation as $\pin \VDash \phi$ where $\phi \in \Lang$ is
a defeasible conditional.

\chapter{Formal Concept Analysis}
\label{chapter:formal-concept-analysis}

\FCA (FCA) \cite{Wille_Restructuring,WILLE1992493,ganter1999formal} is an approach to reasoning about \textit{concepts} and
their corresponding \textit{conceptual structures} in terms of lattice theory. It was first proposed by Wille in his monograph
\textit{Restructuring Lattice Theory} \cite{Wille_Restructuring}, which was an attempt to reestablish a connection between the
theory and practice of lattices.

A core aspect of FCA's foundation is the mathematisation of the philosophical view of concepts, in which a
they are understood as a unit comprising two parts: the \textit{extension}, which is the collection of things
said to be instances of the concept, and the \textit{intension}, which contains those properties used to
ascribe meaning to the concept \cite{DUQUENNE1999407}.

\lucas{I think more needs to be added to this pre-discussion}

\section{Basic Notions}
\label{section:basic-notions}

Despite our omission of a formal introduction to the topic of concepts, one is readily able to grasp the
concept of a `person'. Many sense-making properties come to mind: \textit{mortal}, \textit{warm-blooded},
\textit{mammalian}, and so on. Listing some of the instances included in the extension of this concept is not
particularly challenging either---for example, \textit{the author of this work}, or \textit{the reader}. What
is also clear is that exhaustively detailing a list of either the intension or extension is likely to be a
challenging task, even when these lists are finite, although finiteness need not be a property.

This leads us to---what is usually the starting point of FCA---a structure called a \textit{formal context},
or simply a context. A context restricts our ontological consideration to a reduced universe of discourse, as
well as detailing the underlying structural relationship that exists between elements in this universe
\cite{Wille_Restructuring,Dau2005}.

\begin{definition}
	\index{formal context} \label{definition:formal-context}

	A formal context $\context = \GMI$ is a triple comprised of a set $G$ of objects, a set $M$ of attributes,
	and a binary relation $I \subseteq G \times M$ referred to as an `incidence' relation. For an
	object-attribute pair $(g,m) \in I$ we may say \say{The object $g$ \textit{has} the attribute $m$}.
\end{definition}

We consider the set of objects $G$ (from the German \textit{Gegenstände}) as the extensional dimension of the
context, whereas the set of attributes $M$ (from the German \textit{Merkmale}) represents the intensional
dimension. However, the distinction between the extensional and intensional dimensions of the context is
largely a matter of convention, or a means of improving intuition for when one is first introduced to FCA.
There is no strict requirement around what these sets are made up of, or even that they be distinct. It is
perfectly acceptable to have a context where the objects and attributes are the same set: for example, the
context $(\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{N}, \texttt{divides})$ which describes the division relationship between
natural numbers.

It should be noted that, while the presence of an object--attribute pair $(g,m)$ in the incidence relation is
interpreted as the object satisfying the respective attribute, FCA is usually concerned with
\textit{positive} information. The absence of an object-attribute pair from the relation is not interpreted
to mean that the object has the negation of the attribute. We will discuss, in more depth, the rather
troubling matter of negation and negative attributes in \Cref{section:attribute-logic}.

When the cardinalities of $G$ and $M$ are small, contexts may be represented as a cross-table such as in
\Cref{context:formal-context-group-structures}. Each object is represented by a row in the table, each
attribute by a column, and each pair in the incidence relation is marked with an `$\times$' at the
appropriate position \cite{ganter1999formal}. Given a context presented in this form, it is a trivial task to
identify all the attributes that a particular object satisfies. One need only scan across the respective row
and note where the marks appear. The resulting set of attributes is called the \textit{object's intent}. The
dual notion of an \textit{attribute's extent} can be found by traversing down a column in the table.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\end{cxt}
	\caption{A formal context showing necessary properties of group-like structures.}

	\label{context:formal-context-group-structures}
\end{figure}

Using this approach, we can see that the intent of $\texttt{magma}$ is the singleton $\{\texttt{closure}\}$,
while the extent of \texttt{closure} is the set $\{\texttt{magma,semigroup,monoid,group,abelian
		group,loop,quasigroup}\}$.

This approach to determining object extents and attribute intents becomes impractical when considering
non-trivial contexts, or large sets of objects and attributes. The procedure can be formally described by the
\textit{derivation operators}:
% \footnote{It is common to denote either derivation operator with a prime and use the surrounding context to resolve ambiguity,
% so $A^{\uparrow}$ and $B^{\downarrow}$ would become $A'$ and $B'$, respectively. We avoid this notation as later on it will
% become increasingly challenging to avoid ambiguity while maintaining pleasing notation. In cases where a derivation operator is
% applied to a singleton of objects $\{g\}$ (\textit{resp.} attributes $\{m\}$) we omit the parenthesis and write $g^{\uparrow}$
% (\textit{resp.} $m^{\downarrow}$)}

\begin{definition}
	\index{derivation operators} \label{definition:derivation-operators} \index{attribute!extent} \index{object!intent}

	Given a context $\GMI$, the \textit{derivation operators} are two maps $(\cdot)^{\uparrow}: \pset{G}\to
		\pset{M}$ and $(\cdot )^{\downarrow}: \pset{M}\to \pset{G}$. Then, for any subsets $A \subseteq G$ and $B
		\subseteq M$,
	\begin{align*}
		A^{\uparrow}   & \coloneqq \{m \in M \mid \forall g \in A, \; (g,m) \in I\} \\
		B^{\downarrow} & \coloneqq \{g \in G \mid \forall m \in B, \; (g,m) \in I\}
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

The derivation operators describe a mapping from a subset $A \subseteq G$ of objects in a context to the
corresponding subset of attributes that each (and every) object in $A$ related to. The dual notion holds for
starting with a subset of attributes. As an example, we might wish to determine the set of attributes
satisfied by the objects $\{\texttt{group,groupoid,abelian group}\}$. Application of the $(\cdot)^{\uparrow}$
derivation operator to this set yields $\{\texttt{associative,identity,inverse }\}$.

To offer another perspective on the derivation operators, obvserve that the derivation of a set $A\subseteq
	G$ of objects is the intersection of each object intent, and so we have
\begin{align*}
	A^{\uparrow}= \bigcap \{a^{\uparrow}\mid a \in A\}     & \qquad A \subseteq G  \\
	B^{\downarrow}= \bigcap \{b^{\downarrow}\mid b \in B\} & \qquad B \subseteq M.
\end{align*}

In fact, we have already explored a more general perspective on the derivation operators in
\Cref{section:closure-systems} through the notion of closure operators and Galois connections. The
proposition below recontextualises properties of Galois connections in the setting of FCA.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{proposition:derivation-operators-galois}

	Let $\GMI$ be a formal context and consider the subsets $X,X_{1}\subseteq G$ of objects (\textit{resp.}
	$Y,Y_{1}\subseteq M$ of attributes) then
	\begin{align}
		 & X \subseteq X_{1}\Rightarrow X_{1}^{\uparrow}\subseteq X^{\uparrow} & \textit{(\textit{resp.})} & \qquad Y \subseteq Y_{1}\Rightarrow Y_{1}^{\downarrow}\subseteq Y^{\downarrow}\label{equation:galois-1} \\
		 & X \subseteq X^{\uparrow \downarrow}                                 & \textit{(\textit{resp.})} & \qquad Y \subseteq Y^{\downarrow \uparrow}\label{equation:galois-2}                                     \\
		 & X^{\uparrow}= X^{\uparrow \downarrow \uparrow}                      & \textit{(\textit{resp.})} & \qquad Y^{\downarrow}= Y^{\downarrow \uparrow \downarrow}\label{equation:galois-3}                      \\
		 & X \subseteq Y^{\downarrow}\tiff X^{\uparrow}\supseteq Y             & \label{equation:galois-4}
	\end{align}
\end{proposition}

If we consider the powerset lattices of $\pset{G}$ and $\pset{M}$ equipped with their usual inclusion orders,
then the derivation operators constitute a Galois connection on these sets:
\Cref{equation:galois-1,equation:galois-2,equation:galois-3} are just a rephrasing of
\Cref{equation:ord_galois-1,equation:ord-galois-2,equation:ord-galois-3}; while \Cref{equation:galois-4}
rephrases \Cref{proposition:fundamental-galois}. Mirroring the discussion on Galois connections, we obtain
the closure systems $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ on $G$ and $M$, respectively. Each of these closure
systems form a complete lattice where, recounting \Cref{theorem:closure-systems-lattices}, meets and joins
are given by:
\begin{align*}
	 & \underset{i \in I}\bigwedge A_{i}= \underset{i \in I}\bigcap A_{i}\quad \text{ and }\quad \underset{i \in I}\bigvee A_{i}= \big(\underset{i \in I}\bigcup A_{i}\big)^{\uparrow \downarrow} & \quad A\subseteq \mathcal{G} \\
	 & \underset{i \in I}\bigwedge B_{i}= \underset{i \in I}\bigcap B_{i}\quad \text{ and }\quad\underset{i \in I}\bigvee B_{i}= \big( \underset{i \in I}\bigcup B_{i}\big)^{\downarrow \uparrow} & \quad B\subseteq \mathcal{M}
\end{align*}

For a set of objects $A \subseteq G$, it follows directly from \Cref{equation:galois-3} that $A^{\uparrow}$
is a member of the closure system on $\mathcal{M}$.

\begin{corollary}
	\label{corollary:derivation-closure-systems}

	Given a context $\GMI$ the derivation of a set of objects $A \subseteq G$ (\textit{resp.} attributes $B
		\subseteq M$) is always a member of the closure system $\mathcal{M}$ (\textit{resp.} $\mathcal{G}$).
\end{corollary}

We recall the discussion at the end of \Cref{subsection:galois-connections} where it was shown that a pair of
mappings that form a Galois connection are dually isomorphic when their domains are restricted to the
associated closure systems. With the aid of \Cref{figure:two-lattices}, we note this correspondence between
the lattices of closure systems $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{M}$.

\end{figure}

Earlier, it was suggested that Galois connections are particularly interesting when the closure systems they
induce are themselves interesting, and, future discussion of an example of such interesting closure systems
was promised. Let us now give such an example, and in doing so provide some intuition for why Galois
connections are a useful way of modelling formal concepts, to be introduced immediately afterwards.

Consider the concept derived from the algebraic structure of a \textit{monoid}: a set equipped with a binary
operation that satisfies the properties of closure, associativity, and has an identity element. We should
want to include in the extension of this concept all those algebraic structures that would be considered
subclasses of monoids. These are those structures which satisfy the properties of a monoid (and possibly
additional properties). Of course, a \textit{monoid} should be a member of this extension. Another structure
we should expect to see in this extension is that of a \textit{group}, which satisfies the requirements while
also having an inverse.

Now let us consider the concept derived from a \textit{group}. We have just shown that a group is a subclass
of monoid, so it should follow that the extension of a group must be a subset of the extension of a monoid.
What of the intension? Suppose the intension of the concept of a monoid were not a subset of that of a group,
then monoids would have to satisfy some property that groups did not. This creates a contradiction, as it
would mean we could not properly consider a group to be a subclass of a monoid.

This reveals the relationship between concepts, such that when we move from the more general concept (monoid)
to the more specific concept (group), the extension becomes smaller while the intension grows. The extension
of group is contained within the extension of monoid, but the intension of monoid is contained within the
intension of group. This inverse relationship between the extensions and intensions of concepts is precisely
the kind of relationship described by a Galois connection.

With this in mind, it is finally an appropriate time to define what is meant by \textit{formal concept}:

\begin{definition}
	\index{formal concept} \index{lattice! concept lattice} \label{definition:formal-concept}

	A \emph{formal concept} of a context $\GMI$ is a pair $(A,B)$ where $A \subseteq G$ and $B\subseteq M$ where
	$A^{\uparrow}= B$ and $B^{\downarrow}= A$. We call $A$ the \emph{concept extent} and $B$ the \emph{concept
		intent}. We write $\BGMI$ to denote the set of all concepts of $\GMI$.
\end{definition}

A concept is a pair of closed sets, each representing either the extensional or intensional perspective.
Indeed, there is some degree of redundancy in this definition, as the extension fully determines the
intension and vice verse \cite{ganter2016conceptual}. However, this redundancy is beneficial for ones'
intuition, and so we persevere with it.

A pleasing result of the definition of concepts is that, for any set $A \subseteq G$ of objects, the
derivation $A^{\uparrow}$ will always define a concept intent (the intent of the concept constructed by
$(A^{\uparrow \downarrow}, A^{\uparrow})$). For the same reason, the derivation of any set of attributes $B
	\subseteq M$ will always be a concept extent. In fact, this is fact is merely a rephrasing of
\Cref{corollary:derivation-closure-systems} within the perspective of concepts.

To make this idea concrete, we reconsider the previous discussion where we (informally) described the concept
of a monoid. It follows that the derivation $\{\texttt{monoid }\}^{\uparrow}$ yields the concept intent:
\[
	\{\texttt{closure,associative,identity}\}.
\]
In turn, the derivation of the concept intent results in the set
\[
	\{\texttt{monoid,group,abelian group}\},
\]which is the concept extent, and so
\[
	\big(\{\texttt{monoid,group,abelian group}\}, \{\texttt{closure,associative,identity }\}\big)
\]
is a formal concept of \Cref{cxt:grouplikes}.

The union of concept extents (\textit{resp.}\ intents) does not in general yield another concept extent
(\textit{resp.}\ intent), whereas the intersection of concept extents (\textit{resp.}\ intents) always yields
a concept extent (\textit{resp.}\ intent). \textcolor{red}{Equivalently, the closure systems $\mathcal{G}$
	and $\mathcal{M}$ are not closed under arbitrary unions, but they are closed under arbitrary intersections.}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{proposition:intersection-union-concepts}

	Let $T$ be an indexing set, for every $t \in T$, let $A_{t}\subseteq G$ be a set of objects. Then,
	\[
		\big( \underset{t \in T}\bigcup A_{t}\big)^{\uparrow}= \underset{t \in T}\bigcap A_{t}^{\uparrow}
	\]
\end{proposition}

If we examine the lattices in \Cref{figure:two-lattices}, we observe that the two derivation operators map to
and from the concept intent and extent (shown by the dotted blue arrows). This observation suggests a more
consolidated perspective: The two lattices can be unified into a single structure where elements of the
lattice are precisely the pairs $(A,B)$ where $A \in \mathcal{G}$ and $B \in \mathcal{M}$ and also
$A^{\uparrow}= B$ and $B^{\downarrow}= A$. In other words, the lattice of concepts. We appropriately call
this structure the \textit{concept lattice} of a formal context, and write $\CLGMI$ to refer to the set of
all concepts equipped with this structure.

Reading a concept lattice requires a small amount of getting used to: The labels above a node in the diagram
correspond to attributes, while objects are labelled below a node. Each node represents a concept $C \in
	\BGMI$. The labelled nodes in the concept lattice diagram correspond to either \textit{object} or
\textit{attribute concepts}.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:object-attribute-concepts} \index{attribute!concept}

	Given a context $\context = \GMI$, the \emph{object concepts} are defined for each object $g \in G$ as
	\[
		\gamma g \coloneqq \big(g^{\uparrow \downarrow}, g^{\uparrow}\big),
	\]
	and the \emph{attribute concepts} as
	\[
		\mu m \coloneqq \big(\mu^{\downarrow}, \mu^{\downarrow \uparrow}\big)
	\]
	for each $m \in M$.
\end{definition}

Given a node in the diagram for a concept lattice, the extension of the concept is given by all those objects
labelled at nodes for which there is a (strictly) downward path from the respective node. The concept intent
is given by the labelled attributes with a strictly upward path.

The concept lattice is isomorphic to the closure system $\mathcal{G}$ of objects, and dually isomorphic to
the closure system $\mathcal{M}$ of attributes. We now consider the first part of the fundamental result in
FCA.

\begin{theorem}[The Basic Theorem of Concept Lattices: Part one]
	\label{theorem:basic-theorem-part1} The concept lattice $\CLGMI$ of a formal context is a complete lattice in which meets and joins are given by
	\begin{align*}
		 & \underset{t \in T}\bigwedge (A_{t}, B_{t}) = \Big( \underset{t \in T}\bigcap A_{t}, \; \big(\underset{t \in T}\bigcup B_{t}\big)^{\downarrow \uparrow}\Big) \\
		 & \underset{t \in T}\bigvee (A_{t}, B_{t}) = \Big( \big(\underset{t \in T}\bigcup A_{t}\big)^{\uparrow \downarrow},\; \underset{t \in T}\bigcap B_{t}\Big)
	\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

Part one of the basic theorem describes how we might find the meet and join of concepts in the concept
lattice. To make this clear, recall the isomorphism between $\mathcal{G}$ and $\CLGMI$, which tells us that
\[
	A_{0}\wedge A_{1}\cong (A_{0},B_{0}) \wedge (A_{1},B_{1})
\]
for any $A_{0},A_{1}\in \mathcal{G}$ where $(A_{i},B_{i})$ is the concept with extent $A_{i}$.

The isomorphism between the concept lattice $\CLGMI$ and the lattice corresponding to the closure system
$\mathcal{G}$ means that the meet of any two concepts--- that is, their most general sub-concept---can be
found by considering the concept formed by taking the meet of each of their extensions with respect to
$\mathcal{G}$. Of course, since $\mathcal{G}$ is a closure system, the meet operation on this lattice
corresponds to taking the intersection of these extensions. As there is a dual-isomorphism between $\CLGMI$
and $\mathcal{M}$, we may equivalently discover the most general sub-concept of two concepts by considering
the join operation on the concept intensions with respect to the lattice of $\mathcal{M}$. This corresponds
to taking the closure of the union of concept intensions (cf. \Cref{theorem:closure-systems-lattices} for a
reminder of why).

The join of two concepts---again, due to the dual isomorphism---corresponds to the meet operation on the
concept extensions with respect to the lattice of $\mathcal{M}$ and can thus be found by taking the
intersection of their intensions, under which $\mathcal{M}$ is closed. Or, by the join operation on
$\mathcal{G}$, which corresponds to the closure of the union of extensions.

For another perspective, consider that each $A_{t}$ is equivalent to $B_{t}^{\downarrow}$. By
\Cref{proposition:intersection-union-concepts}

\begin{align*}
	 & \underset{t \in T}\bigwedge (A_{t}, B_{t}) = \Big( \underset{t \in T}\bigcap A_{t}, \; \big(\underset{t \in T}\bigcup B_{t}\big)^{\downarrow \uparrow}\Big)
\end{align*}

can be restated as

\begin{align*}
	 & \underset{t \in T}\bigwedge (A_{t}, B_{t}) = \Big(\big(\underset{t \in T}\bigcup B_{t}\big)^{\downarrow}, \; \big(\underset{t \in T}\bigcup B_{t}\big)^{\downarrow \uparrow}\Big)
\end{align*}

We may arrive at the concept lattice in another way, by considering the rather natural order on concepts
which arises from the \textit{subconcept--superconcept} relation. We had, earlier, discussed that `group' is
a subclass of `monoid', and so the extension of the associated concept of a group should be a subset of that
of a monoid. In line with this, we say that a concept $( A_{0},B_{0})$ is a subconcept of another
$(A_{1},B_{1})$ if and only if $A_{0}\subseteq A_{1}$. Dually, $(A_{1},B_{1})$ is a superconcept of
$(A_{0},B_{0})$ if and only if $B_{1}\subseteq B_{0}$. In this case we write $(A_{0},B_{0}) \leq
	(A_{1},B_{1})$. When considering the set of concepts $\BGMI$ with the relation defined by $\leq$, the
resulting structure is the same concept lattice $\CLGMI$ from before. As an illustration, consider the two
selected concepts in \Cref{figure:concept-lattice-group-likes}.

\textcolor{red}{I think it is worth mentioning some discussion on how, as a result of the basic theorem,
	formal concept analysis is just a restructuring of lattice theory. I.e., it makes work on complete lattices
	more accessible. Worthwhile in terms of motivations behind formal concept analysis. Restructuring also
	relates to attribute logic, so this is a good place to do it. }

% about ``protoconcepts''; but I think maybe this should be done right before we discuss typical concepts. }

\section{Attribute Logic}
\label{section:attribute-logic}

This section explores several of the more \textit{logic}-related ideas that present themselves in FCA. In
light of \Cref{section:propositional-logic}, many of the notions here should be somewhat familiar. However,
we follow the the advice from Ganter \shortcite{ganter2025language} where it is suggested that we think of
logic, as it relates to FCA, not in terms of truth values, but rather attributes and conceptual meaning.

We begin by studying the \textit{implication logic} of FCA, which is perhaps most fundamental. Afterwards, we
will discuss a more expressive logic.

\subsection{Implication Logic}
\label{subsection:implication-logic}

It is often sufficient to study what is, in terms of expressivity, a fairly restricted logic. This is the
\textit{implication} logic of FCA. From the perspective of mathematical logic, it is analogous to
propositional definite Horn logic. That is, clauses with precisely one positive literal.

An implication describes a correspondence between attributes, expressing the idea that \say{Whenever we see
	attribute $m$, we also see attribute $n$}. Formally, we have:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:implication}

	An \emph{implication} over a set $M$ of attributes is written $A \rightarrow B$, where $A,B \subseteq M$. We
	call $A$ the \textit{premise} and $B$ the \textit{conclusion} of the implication.
\end{definition}

The semantics of attribute implications quite closely resemble the material implications outlined in
\Cref{section:propositional-logic}; however, we are interested in attribute implications as they relate to
formal contexts, and so we define the semantics with this in mind.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:implication-respect}

	Another set of attributes $C \subseteq M$ \textit{respects} the implication if either $A \not \subseteq C$ or
	$B \subseteq C$, in which case we write $C \vDash A \rightarrow B$ and call $C$ a \emph{model} of the
	implication. If $\mathcal{T}$ is a set of implications, $C$ is a model of $\mathcal{T}$ if it respects every
	implication in $\mathcal{T}$. A formal context $\context = \GMI$ \emph{respects} an implication $A
		\rightarrow B$ over $M$ if and only if the intent $g^{\uparrow}$ of each object $g \in G$ respects the
	implication, in which case we write $\context \vDash A \rightarrow B$; this idea is extended to a set of
	implications as expected.
\end{definition}

Recall that in FCA we are usually only interested in positive information, we cannot---at least for the time
being---speak about attribute implications with disjunction or negation. In
\Cref{subsection:compound-attributes} we discuss how we might increase the expressivity of the logic.

The definition for when a context respects an implication admits a more concise representation: It is
equivalent to the expression that $A^{\downarrow}\subseteq B^{\downarrow}$, or $B \subseteq A^{\downarrow
			\uparrow}$. Recalling \Cref{corollary:derivation-closure-systems}, which asserts that both $A^{\downarrow}$
and $B^{\downarrow}$ are always concept extents, we have the following:

\begin{proposition}
	\label{proposition:implication-concepts}

	The implication $A \rightarrow B$ is respected by a context $\GMI$ if and only if the concept derived from
	$A$ is a sub-concept of the one derived from $B$. Formally, if $(A^{\downarrow}, A^{\downarrow \uparrow})
		\leq (B^{\downarrow}, B^{\downarrow \uparrow})$ holds.
\end{proposition}

For an illustration, we consider whether the implication $\{\texttt{inverse,associative}\} \rightarrow
	\{\texttt{identity}\}$ holds in the context of group-likes. Indeed, the concept lattice in
\Cref{figure:concept-lattice-group-likes} confirms that
\[
	(\{\texttt{inverse,associative}\}^{\downarrow},\{\texttt{inverse,associative}\}^{\downarrow \uparrow}) \leq (\{\texttt{identity}\}^{\uparrow}, \{\texttt{identity }\}^{\uparrow \downarrow}),
\]
and so the implication holds. Reading implications off a concept lattice in this \textit{bottom-up} manner is convenient, but there is a more significant
connection between attribute implications and concept lattices. We explore this connection in the next section.

\subsubsection{Implication Inference}
\label{subsubsection:implication-inference}

It is interesting to discuss the matter of logical consequence in the setting of attribute implications. The
definition is quite natural, and describes a Tarskian notion of consequence.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:implication-inference}

	An implication $A\rightarrow B$ \emph{logically follows} from a set $\mathcal{T}$ of implications over $M$ if
	and only if each attribute subset $C \subseteq M$ that is a model of $\mathcal{T}$ is also a model of $A
		\rightarrow B$, then we write $\mathcal{T}\vDash A \rightarrow B$.
\end{definition}

A set $\mathcal{T}$ of attribute implications is called \textit{closed}, or an \textit{implication theory},
when it contains all implications that logically follow from it. It is \textit{complete} with respect to some
closure operator if every implication that holds for a respective closure operator follows from the theory.
If $\mathcal{T}$ is complete with respect to the closure operator $(\cdot)^{\downarrow\uparrow}$ then it is a
complete implication theory of the formal context to which the derivation operators refer
\cite{ganter2016conceptual,ganter2024formal}. This is formalised as:

\begin{proposition}
	\label{proposition:implication-sets-and-concept-intents}

	If $\mathcal{T}$ is a set of implications over an attribute set $M$, then the set $\Mod{\mathcal{T}}\coloneq
		\{ A \subseteq M \mid A \vDash \mathcal{T}\}$ of its models form a closure system on $\pset{M}$.

	If $\mathcal{T}$ is the complete implication theory of $\GMI$ then the closure system $\Mod{\mathcal{T}}$ is
	precisely the system of concept intents of the context.
\end{proposition}

It is reasonably obvious that every concept intent of a context $\context = \GMI$ is a model of the
implication theory of $\mathbb{K}$. For the converse, which is less clear, assume $X \subseteq M$ is a model
of the implication theory but not a concept intent. Then $X \neq X^{\downarrow\uparrow}$, so there exists
some attribute $m \in X^{\downarrow\uparrow}\setminus X$. By definition of closure, this means that every
object $g \in X^{\downarrow}$ has $(g,m) \in I$, hence $X \cup \{m\}$ is closed, i.e. a concept intent. But
then the implication $X \rightarrow{m}$ holds in $\mathbb{K}$, and since $X$ does not contain $m$, $X$ fails
to satisfy this implication. This contradicts the assumption that $X$ is a model. Therefore every model of
the implication theory is necessarily a concept intent.

The following closure operator describes how a set of attributes can be closed under a set of implications.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:closure-operator-implications}

	Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a set of implications over a set of attributes $M$. For a set $X \subseteq M$ of
	attributes, the closure of $X$ with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ is given by
	% \[ X^{\mathcal{T}}= X \cup \bigcup \{\, B \mid (A \rightarrow B) \in \mathcal{T}, \; A \subseteq X \,\}, \] which extends $X$ by
	% adding all conclusions of implications in $\mathcal{T}$ whose premises are contained within $X$. The sequence $X^{\mathcal{T}},
	% X^{\mathcal{T} \mathcal{T}}, \ldots$ will reach a fixed-point $\Cna{\mathcal{T}}{X}\coloneqq X^{\mathcal{T} \ldots \mathcal{T}}$
	% where $\Cna{\mathcal{T}}{X}= \Cna{\mathcal{T}}{X}^{\mathcal{T}}$. This fixed point defines the \emph{closure of $X$ under
	% $\mathcal{T}$}. Equivalently, for the infinite case, we have:
	\[
		\Cna{\mathcal{T}}{X}= \bigcap \{\, W \mid X \subseteq W \subseteq M, \; W \in \mathsf{Mod}(\mathcal{T})\,\}.
	\]
	% the intersection of all models $W$ of $\mathcal{T}$ that contain $X$.
\end{definition}

Consider the case where $X$ is already a model of the theory, the $\Cna{\mathcal{T}}{X}= X$. Otherwise, the
closure of $X$ under $\mathcal{T}$ is the smallest closed set which subsumes $X$. It is the \textit{smallest}
by the fact that $\mathsf{Mod}(\mathcal{T})$ is a closure sytem, and thus closed under arbitrary
intersections. Then, we have a concise representation of when an implication follows from a set of
implications.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{proposition:}

	An implication $A \rightarrow B$ is a logical consequence of a set of implications $\mathcal{T}$ over $M$ if
	and only if $B \subseteq \Cna{\mathcal{T}}{A}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}
	\lucas{I can't think of a good example to show the implicaiton/closure relation. I was thinking something to do with the Bonghard puzzles}
\end{example}

The \nameref{algorithm:LinClosure} algorithm \cite{maier1983chapter4}, and slightly modified by
\cite{ganter2016conceptual}, describes a procedure which finds the closure of an attribute set with respect
to a set of implications. The algorithm is linear on the size of the implication set, and so computing. The
first block of the algorithm, lines \ref{line:1}--\ref{line:8}, determines the size of the premise for each
implication, the respective implication is then associated with each individual attribute in the premise. All
implications with an empty premise are vacuously satisfied, and so their conclusions are added to $X$.

The result is a tally, for each implication, of how many attributes are required to satisfy the premise; and,
for each attribute $m \in M$ a list of implications for which $m$ appears in the antecedent. All attributes
from $X$, alongside the conclusions of vacuously satisfied implications, are stored in \textit{update}.

\begin{algo}{\textsc{LinClosure}}

	\label{algorithm:LinClosure}

	\Require An attribute set $X\subseteq M$ and a set $\mathcal{T}$ of implications over $M$.

	\Ensure The closure of $X$ with respect to $\mathcal{T}$.

	\ForAll {$A\rightarrow B \in \mathcal{T}$} \label{line:1}

	\State $\textit{count}[A \rightarrow B] \coloneqq \vert A \vert$

	\If {$\vert A \vert = 0$}

	\State $X \coloneqq X \cup B$

	\EndIf

	\ForAll{ $m \in A$ }

	\State add $A \rightarrow B$ to \textit{list}$[a]$

	\EndFor

	\EndFor \label{line:8}

	\State \textit{update} $\coloneqq X$

	\While{$\textit{update}\neq \emptyset$} \label{line:11}

	\State Choose $m \in \textit{update}$

	\State $\textit{update}\coloneqq \textit{update}\setminus \{m\}$

	\ForAll {$A\rightarrow B \in \textit{list}[m]$}

	\State $\textit{count}[A \rightarrow B] \coloneqq \textit{count}[A \rightarrow B] - 1$

	\EndFor

	\If {$\textit{count}[A \rightarrow B] = 0$}

	\State $\textit{add}\coloneqq B \setminus X$

	\State $X \coloneqq X \cup \textit{add}$

	\State $\textit{update}\coloneqq \textit{update}\cup \textit{add}$

	\EndIf

	\EndWhile \label{line:22}

	\State \Return $X$
\end{algo}

The second block, lines \ref{line:11}--\ref{line:22}, chooses an attribute $m \in \textit{update}$ and for
each of its associated implications, given by $\textit{ list}[m]$, decrements the counter associated with the
implications premise. If an implication's counter reaches zero, the conclusion (after removing any attributes
which have already been dealt with, or will be dealt with in future) is added to \textit{update}. The process
repeats until \textit{update} is empty, afterwhich the closed set is returned.

% \begin{proposition} \label{proposition:complexity-lin-closure}

% The complexity of \nameref{algorithm:LinClosure} is $O(\vert \mathcal{T}\vert)$, and so the procedure is linear on the size of
% the implication set. \end{proposition}

There is a syntactic counterpart to the semantic notions of consequence, defined in terms of the Armstrong
axioms \cite{armstrong1974dependency}.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:armstrong-axioms} The \emph{Armstrong axioms} are defined as inference rules of the form:
	\begin{align}
		\inferLeftNoLabel{}{A \rightarrow A}, \qquad \inferLeftNoLabel{A \rightarrow B}{A \cup C \rightarrow B}, \qquad \inferLeftNoLabel{A \rightarrow B, \quad B \cup C \rightarrow D}{A \cup C \rightarrow D}
	\end{align}
	where $A,B,C,D \subseteq M$.
\end{definition}

The interpretation should be that, if the instantiation of an Armstrong axiom has its premise contained in a
set $\mathcal{T}$ of implications, then the conclusion of the axiom may be inferred. To show that an
implication is a consequence of some set one shows that there is a sequence of application of these rules
that leads to the desired implication.

\subsubsection{Implication Bases}
\label{subsubsection:implication-bases}

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:implication-basis}

	If $\mathcal{T}$ is a set of implications then $\mathcal{B}$ is an \emph{implication basis} of $\mathcal{T}$
	if and only if
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\mathcal{B}$ is sound with respect to $\mathcal{T}$, i.e. if $\mathcal{B}\vDash A \rightarrow B$ then $\mathcal{T}\vDash A \rightarrow B$

		\item $\mathcal{B}$ is complete with respect to $\mathcal{T}$, i.e. if $\mathcal{T}\vDash A \rightarrow B$ then $\mathcal{B}\vDash A \rightarrow B$

		\item $\mathcal{B}$ is non-redundant, i.e. $\nexists i \in \mathcal{T}\text{ such that }\mathcal{T}\setminus \{i\} \vDash i$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Soundness and completeness are obviously properties that an implication basis should satisfy. Given that
checking logical consequence is linear on the size of the implication set, having non-redundant implications
is computationally appealing.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:pseudo-closed}

	A set $X\subseteq M$ is \emph{pseudo-closed} if it is not closed, and each proper subset of $X$ is itself
	pseudo closed. Formally,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $X \neq X^{\downarrow \uparrow}$

		\item $Y \subset X$ is pseudo-closed for all $Y \subset X$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	\textcolor{red}{Give an the canonical base of the algebraic structures}

	\begin{center}
		$\left\{ \;
			\begin{aligned}
				 & \{\texttt{commutative}\} \rightarrow \{\texttt{closure, identity, inverse, associative}\} \\
				 & \{\texttt{inverse, associative}\} \rightarrow \{\texttt{identity}\}
			\end{aligned}
			\right\}$
	\end{center}

	Examine \Cref{cxt:truth-table}
\end{example}

\subsection{Compound Attributes}
\label{subsection:compound-attributes}

The implication logic of FCA, despite giving rise to interesting results like the canonical basis, is quite
limited. Certain settings require more expressive power. \textit{Compound attributes} are introduced for this
purpose. We use the lowercase Greek alphabet to denote compound attributes as they quite closely resemble
propositional formulae, \textit{atomic} (normal) attributes will continue to be denoted with lowercase Latin
alphabet.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:compound-attributes} \index{attribute!compound}

	Let $M$ be a set of attributes (as we might find in a formal context). A compound attribute is constructed by
	iterative application of the following: \setlist{nolistsep}
	\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0em]
		\item An \textit{atomic} attribute $m\in M$ is a compound attribute

		\item If $\varphi \in \Ca{M}$ is a compound attribute, then so is $\neg \varphi$

		\item If $\Gamma \subseteq \Ca{M}$ is a set of compound attributes, then $\bigwedge \Gamma$ is a compound attribute
	\end{itemize}
	We write $\Ca{M}$ to denote the set of all compound attributes over the attribute set $M$.
\end{definition}

The definition allows for arbitrarily complex compound attributes to be constructed. The semantics of these
are given by their extension, relative to a formal context.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:compound-attributes-semantics} \index{semantics!compound attributes}

	In a formal context $\GMI$, the extension of each compound attribute $\varphi \in \Ca{M}$ is written
	$\varphi^{\vDash}$ and defined inductively as follows: \setlist{nolistsep}
	\begin{itemize}[itemsep=-0em]
		\item If $\varphi$ is an atomic attribute (i.e., $\varphi \in M$) then $\varphi^{\vDash}\coloneq \varphi^{\downarrow}$

		\item If $\varphi$ is the negation of another compound attribute $\gamma \in \Ca{M}$ then $\varphi^{\vDash}\coloneq G \setminus \gamma^{\vDash}$

		\item If $\varphi$ is the result of a conjunction of a set of compound attributes $\bigwedge \Gamma$ then $\varphi^{\vDash}\coloneq \underset{\gamma \in
				      \Gamma}\bigcap \gamma^{\vDash}$
	\end{itemize}
	For an object $g\in G$ and compound attribute $\varphi \in \Ca{M}$, we write $g \vDash \varphi$ if and only
	if $g$ is in the extension of $\varphi$ and we say $g$ \emph{satisfies} $\varphi$, otherwise $g \nvDash
		\varphi$.
\end{definition}

Other kinds of compound attributes which express useful intuition, in particular the disjunction of compound
attributes, have an equivalent construction using only \Cref{definition:compound-attributes}. If $\Gamma$ is
a set of compound attributes, then the disjunction of its elements $\bigvee \Gamma$ then its extension
$\bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma}\gamma^{\vDash}$ is the union of all extensions of compound attributes in the
set. Such a compound attribute is equivalent to $\neg \bigwedge \Gamma$.

The proposed equivalence of $\bigvee \Gamma$ and $\neg \bigwedge \Gamma$ necessitates some further
discussion; it is possible for two compound attributes to be equivalent in one formal context, but not in
another. We might say that in the former case, these attributes are \textit{locally} equivalent.
\textit{Global} equivalence is stronger, requiring that the equivalence hold for any context.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:equivalence-compound-attributes}

	Two compound attributes are \textit{extensionally equivalent}, or \textit{locally equivalent}, with respect
	to a formal context if and only if they share the same extension. They are \textit{globally equivalent} if
	and only if they would share the same extension in any possible context.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	From the formal context described below we may construct two compound attributes
	\begin{align*}
		\varphi \coloneqq \bigwedge \{\texttt{human,unstuck}\} \, \tand \, \psi \coloneqq \neg \texttt{violent},
	\end{align*}
	%
	which are marked in light grey.

		\caption{A context describing characters and some of their qualities, from Slaughterhouse 5}
		\label{figure:context-slaughterhouse5}
	\end{figure}
	Each of these compound attributes have the extension consisting solely of $\{\texttt{Billy Pilgrim}\}$, and
	so at least they are locally equivalent. It may come as no surprise that their equivalence is not global:
	suppose Tralfamadorians were not violent. If we consider a third compound attribute, $\neg \neg
		\texttt{violent}$, we would find that it is globally equivalent to the attribute \texttt{violent}.
\end{example}

A somewhat blunt approach to determining if two compound attributes, over a set $M$ of attributes, are
globally equivalent is to test for extensional equivalence in the formal context $(\pset{M}, M, \ni)$, such a
context is called the \textit{test context} over $M$.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:compound-attributes-2}

	Let $M$ be a set of attributes, then the language of (finite) compound attributes is inductively as
	%
	\begin{align}
		\phi ::= m \mid (\neg \phi) \mid (\phi_{1}\lor \phi_{2}) \mid (\phi_{1}\land \phi_{2}) \mid (\phi_{1}\rightarrow \phi_{2})
	\end{align}
	%
	where $m \in M$ is a ``plain'' attribute. Then, the satisfaction relation $\Vdash$ is

	\begin{itemize}
		\item $g \Vdash \varphi$ if and only if $g \in \varphi^{\downarrow}$

		\item $g \Vdash \neg \varphi$ if and only if $g \in G \setminus \varphi^{\Vdash}$

		\item $g \Vdash \varphi \lor \gamma$ if and only if $g \in \varphi^{\Vdash}\cup \gamma^{\Vdash}$

		\item $g \Vdash \varphi \land \gamma$ if and only if $g \in \varphi^{\Vdash}\cap \gamma^{\Vdash}$

		\item $g \Vdash \varphi \rightarrow \gamma$ if and only if $g \in \neg \varphi^{\Vdash}\lor \gamma^{\Vdash}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

% \clearpage \subsection{Clause Logic} \label{subsection:clause-logic}

% The inductive definition of compound attributes admits the construction of arbitrarily many compound attributes. We may
% represent them, up to global equivalence, as \textit{clauses}: \begin{definition} \label{definition:clauses}

% A \emph{clause} $(A,S)$, where $A,S \subseteq M$, represents a compound attribute that is globally equivalent to the compound
% attribute $\bigvee S \cup \{\neg a \mid a \in A\}$. \end{definition}

% The extension of $(A,S)$ in a context $\GMI$ is defined as the set of objects which satisfy at least one attribute in $S$ or
% fail to satisfy at least one attribute in $A$. Formally, \[ (A,S)^{\vDash}= \{ g \in G \mid \exists s \in S,\; g\vDash s \}
% \;\cup\; \{ g \in G \mid \exists a \in A,\; g \nvDash a \} \] Clauses are called \textit{disjoint} when $A \cap S$ is the
% emptyset. The following definition is helpful to describe the set of all clauses which are satisfied by a context: %
% \begin{definition} \label{definition:all-extensional}

% A compound attribute $\varphi \in \Ca{M}$ is \emph{all-extensional} in a context $\GMI$ if and only if $\varphi^{\vDash}= G$. In
% other words, if the extension of the attribute is the complete set of objects. \end{definition}

% A disjoint clause $(A,S)$ is called \textit{full} when also $A \cup S$ is the entire attribute set $M$. \begin{proposition}
% \label{proposition:clause-up-to-equivalence}

% If $\varphi \in \Ca{M}$ is a compound attribute then there exists a clause $(A,S)$ with $A,S \subseteq M$ that is globally
% equivalent to $\varphi$ \end{proposition}

% % \begin{example} % The implication $\{\texttt{traumatized}\}\rightarrow \{\texttt{human,soldier}\}$ holds as the concept
% derived from the premise, is a subconcept of both $\mu \texttt{human}$ % and $\mu \texttt{soldier}$.

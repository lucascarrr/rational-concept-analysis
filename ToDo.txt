1. Add section on complexity theory in prelims
2. Do complexity results for Algorithms
3. The reason we take the closure of extents for C1 V C2 is because the V (on the concept lattice) is the closure operation for the closure system on M

    - If we have (A1,B1) V (A2,B2), the intersection of B1 and B2 is closed, because that is the closure operator on the closure system on G. So the V operation operation on 
    the concept lattice corresponds is isomorphic to intersection on the Closure sytem on G. 


1. Make "Figure 1: xx" the <Figure 1> part bold. 


## Symbol Usage
1. Vdash ||- 
    should be used when some structure satisfies a defeasible conditional. I.e., a ranked interpretation.
2. vDash |=
    Should be used when a single valuation satis

\chapter{Defeasible Reasoning}
\label{chapter:defeasible-reasoning}

Non-monotonicity in logical systems has been the focus of study for decades, and several distinct formalisms have been developed.
The motivation is to expand the inference power beyond that of the classical, to a more credulous one where inferences may,
upon learning new information, be retracted.

This work is interested in the kind of non-monotonic reasoning put forward by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what},
frequently initialised to the \textit{KLM framework}.

\textcolor{red}{This could be a bit more discursive I think}

\section{Background on Non-monotonic Reasoning}
\label{section:nmr-background}

Near the end of the previous chapter, the matter of consequence was discussed in a very formal sense. It is perhaps
helpful to distinguish this subject---classical consequence---from the common concept, as the former yields some surprising
results which do not appear at all congruent with how a person, or otherwise intelligent agent should reason
\cite{tarski1936consequence, kraus1990nonmonotonic}. As a demonstration of a result which may be surprising in this way,
consider the following propositions, which state that \textit{humans experience chronological time \text{,} soldiers are
human}, and \textit{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\texttt{human}\rightarrow \texttt{chronological time}$

	\item $\texttt{soldier}\rightarrow \texttt{human}$

	\item $\texttt{Billy Pilgrim}\rightarrow \neg \texttt{chronological time}$
\end{enumerate}

Knowing these propositions, if we were to encounter an individual in combat fatigues we might find it sensible---by propositions
2 and 1---to deduce that the individual experienced time chronologically. If we were to later learn that the individual
were, in fact, Billy Pilgrim, given proposition 3, we should like to retract our prior inference and replace it with the
knowledge that the individual does not experience time chronologically.

Such recourse is not, as it stands, possible. When we see the that the individual is a soldier, the possible worlds
satisfying our existing knowledge are reduced to the single model: $\{\overline{b},c,h,s\}$ (where $b$: \texttt{Billy
Pilgrim}, $c$: \texttt{chronological time}, $h$: \texttt{human}, and $s$: \texttt{soldier}). Should we later learn that the
individual is indeed Billy Pilgrim, the theory becomes inconsistent.
%TODO: Add section in preliminaries about principle of explosion
And, by the principle of explosion, discussed in \Cref{subsection:logical-consequence}, our theory now entails that the
individual experiences time both chronologically and non-chronologically. Indeed, our theory now entails everything and
is accordingly worthless.

This property of classical logic---that adding new information never results in retraction of pre-existing knowledge---is
called monotonicity. The presence of monotonicity requires that when we make a claim such as \say{humans experience time chronologically},
we must be absolutely sure of ourselves, so as to never worry about needing to retract an inference. This is, of course,
too strict a requirement as we cannot determine for all future, present, and past humans if it were the case that they experienced
time chronologically. If we remain in the classical realm, it seems our only options are to abandon our original claim or
risk explosion.

At this point it is a good idea to provide some clarification on how we might begin to approach solutions to this issue.
Continuing with the same example---and continuing to allow ourselves to entertain the possibility of experiencing non-chronological
time---it would certainly be agreed that typically soldiers are human, and also that typically humans experience time chronologically.
To resolve that Billy Pilgrim is a soldier, and therefore a human, who does not experience chronological time, we need only
to point out that he may be an atypical human, and so the qualities we associate with typical humans need not apply to
him.

To make the previous paragraph more formal, we remind the reader of the discussion held around \Cref{definition:logical-consequence}:
A formula $\phi$ is a logical consequence of a set $\Gamma$ thereof if every model of $\Gamma$ is also a model of $\phi$.
Put differently, there is no valuation (or, possible world) where $\Gamma$ is true and $\phi$ is false. It follows
directly that $\phi$ remains a logical consequence of $\Gamma \cup \{\psi\}$, since $\Gamma$ is true in any world where $\Gamma
\cup \{\psi\}$ is true. It was pointed out by Shoham \cite{shohamSemanticApproach} that we may \say{bend the rules} and restrict
semantic consideration to a privileged subset of models deemed ``preferable''. We call these selected models the \textit{minimal
models}---the reasons for this name should become clearer as the chapter progresses.

\section{KLM and Preferential Reasoning}
The KLM framework for non-monotonic reasoning was initially described by a collection of consequence relations satisfying
certain axioms---frequently called the \textit{rationality postulates}, thought to describe a reasonable account of non-monotonic
consequence. We borrow a nice story from Dov Gabbay \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations} which motivates why
consequence relations are a good starting point for the study of non-monotonic systems.

Paraphrasing, he begins by asking the reader to imagine a machine that does non-monotonic inference in some domain. The
machine represents knowledge as formulae and so we pose queries of the form \say{Does $\psi$ non-monotonically follow from $\phi$?}.
Something goes awry (suppose some coffee was spilled), calling into question whether the logic of the machine still functions
correctly. Even worse, the interface, which tells us what real-world instance each formula maps to, is destroyed and so function
cannot be evaluated based on the meaning of the formulae the machine reasons on. How might we then evaluate the machine's
function?

If we were interested in classical consequence, we would be well-equipped to assess the correctness of the machine by determining
if it satisfied reflexivity, monotonicity, and cut (we point to \Cref{definition:consequence-relations} as a reminder).
This is precisely the starting point that Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor took up in \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic}, suggesting
that before getting to the semantics of a non-monotonic system, it is a good idea to formalise axiomatise the system as
a consequence relation satisfying certain properties.

The rationality postulates are precisely this axiomatisation, characterising a sensible pattern of reasoning for non-monotonic
systems. We use `$\twiddle$' (pronounced ``twiddle'') instead of `$\vdash$' to denote a non-monotonic consequence
relation. As we may expect, $\phi \twiddle \psi$ has the same meaning as $(\phi, \psi) \in \; \twiddle$, and $\phi \ntwiddle
\psi$ as $(\phi, \psi)\not \in \; \twiddle$. We may, at times of potential confusion, use a subscript to disambiguate
which consequence relation is being referred to, and so $\twiddle_{C}$ would refer to a cumulative relation, as defined
below.

\subsection{Cumulative Reasoning}
\label{subsection:system-c} \index{non-monotonic reasoning! system C}

\textit{Cumulative consequence relations}, otherwise referred to as \textit{system C}, represent the weakest of the systems
in the KLM framework. We follow the same exposition, from weaker to stronger systems, as \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic}: this
approach will minimise repetition, as each successive system inherits all properties of its predecessor.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:cumulative-consequence-relation} \index{consequence relations! cumulative}

	A consequence relation $\twiddle$ is a \emph{cumulative consequence relation} if and only if it satisfies the properties
	of \emph{Reflexivity, Left Logical Equivalence, Right Weakening, Cut} and \emph{Cautious Monotonicity}.
\end{definition}

The first axiom, \textit{Reflexivity}, is largely self justifying: It makes little sense to speak about a notion of consequence
that does not satisfy this property.

\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:ref}\inferLeft{Reflexivity}{}{\phi \twiddle \phi}
\end{align}

The justification for \textit{Left Logical Equivalence} is a bit more opaque; the principle is that if two scenarios
represent the same state of affairs, and in one of these scenarios it we typically expect some consequence, then we
should expect the same in the other scenario.

\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:lle}\inferLeft{Left Logical Equivalence}{\vdash \phi \leftrightarrow \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma}{\psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Right Weakening} allows the preservation of classical consequence within the logic. It says that if it is always
the case that from knowing $\psi$ we conclude $\gamma$, and from knowing $\phi$ we normally conclude $\psi$, then we are
entitled to hold the view that from $\phi$ we normally expect $\gamma$ as well.

\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:rw}\inferLeft{Right Weakning}{\vdash \psi \rightarrow \gamma, \quad \phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Cautious Monotony} (which has also be called \textit{Cumulative Monotony} by Makinson \cite{makinson2003bridges},
and \textit{Restricted Monotony} by Gabbay \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}) corresponds to the notion that if we
are in an epistemic state $\phi$ where one expectation, among others, is that $\psi$ holds. Learning that $\psi$ indeed holds
should not alter the epistemic state in such a way that the \textit{other} expectations are abandoned, and so the new state,
$\phi \land \psi$, we should expect everything that was expected when all we knew was $\phi$. In other words, we reason monotonically
with respect to expected information.

\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:cm}\inferLeft{Cautious Monotony}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma }{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

Certain other rules may derived from the presence of already discussed postulates. A version of \textit{Cut}

\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:cut}\inferLeft{Cut}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

The original version due to Gentzen \cite{Ben1993Mathematical} is presented as:
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Monotonic Cut}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \alpha \twiddle \psi}{\phi \land \alpha \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
implies monotonicity, as it requires that if $\psi$ is a typical consequence of $\alpha$, then it must remain a consequence
of $\alpha \land \phi$: ergo, monotonicity. The former variation does not enforce this, and rather says \say{Suppose I have certain knowledge of $\phi$, and that if I were to assume $\psi$ I should expect to conclude $\gamma$. Then if I can show that infact $\psi$ was already an expected consequence of knowing $\phi$, I should expect that $\gamma$ follows from $\phi$}.
When considered alongside the argument for Cautious Monotony, Cut seems obviously acceptable.

The \textit{And} postulate suggests that if $\psi$ and $\gamma$ are both expected consequence of $\phi$, then their
conjunction is also expected. This postulate fails in probabilistic systems, such as \textit{association rules} \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}.
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:and}\inferLeft{And}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \psi \land \gamma}
\end{align}

The following Lemma is a helpful intuition pump, it is largely why the term \textit{cumulative} is used for this system:
it suggests that we can use the consequences of plausible inferences to make further plausible inferences.
\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:cut-cautious} We can cover the properties of \emph{cut} and \emph{cautious monotonicity} with the following
	principle: \say{If $\phi \twiddle \psi$, then the typical consequences of $\phi$ and $\phi \land \psi$ coincide}.
\end{lemma}

Certain, frequently discussed properties in classical logic do not hold in cumulative consequence relations. Most
obviously, cumulative consequence relations do not satisfy the following:
%
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:monotonicity}\inferLeft{Monotonicity}{\psi \rightarrow \gamma, \quad \gamma \twiddle \phi}{\psi \twiddle \phi}
\end{align}
%
In addition, \textit{Transitivity} and \textit{Contraposition} both imply monotonicity when considered alongside the other
rules of cumulative relations
%
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:trans}\inferLeft{Transitivity}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

% Transitivity, in \Cref{proof:transitivity}, was shown to be quite useful as a derived rule of a Hilbert system; but, for
% our purposes, it will not do. Consider the example at the beginning of this chapter, where the topic of whether we should
% infer that Billy Pilgrim experiences chronological time. Transitivity requires that we infer he does: Billy Pilgrim is a
% soldier, soldiers are human, and humans experience time chronologically. But this is precisely the inference we do not
% want, and so transitivity must be abandoned.
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:contra}\inferLeft{Contraposition}{\phi \twiddle \psi}{\neg \psi \twiddle \neg \phi}
\end{align}

These properties are undesirable as they imply monotonicity. It is, however, worth reminding ourselves of the goal that
was set out at the start of this chapter: To formalise a system which facilitates a more credulous style of reasoning.
That is, we are interested in making \textit{more} inferences than can be made under classical notions of consequence. One
property which has not been discussed---and which may be quite easy to assume---is whether the proposed system be \textit{supraclassical}
\cite{makinson2003bridges}.
%
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:supraclassical}\inferLeft{Supraclassical}{\phi \rightarrow \psi}{\phi \twiddle \psi}
\end{align}
%
Supraclassicality is the question of whether classical inferences be preserved in a non-classical system. It seems
reasonable to answer this question in the affirmative. Defeasible inferences are useful as they tolerate reasoning with exceptions,
allowing useful inferences that could not be made in classical systems. It seems that the dual of this, where some non-defeasible
(that is, classical) inference is made, it is because no exceptions apply. In this case, we have an even stronger claim
to make this inference.

\textcolor{red}{Diagram ovals of worlds}

We will skip over any discussion of semantics for cumulative consequence relations, and rather opt to introduce these in
the next section where we discuss preferential consequence relations.

\subsection{Preferential Reasoning}
\label{subsection:system-P} \index{non-monotonic reasoning! system P}

We, quite quickly, move on from cumulative to \textit{preferential consequence relations}, or \textit{system P}. The
reason being that system P is strictly stronger than system C, and includes in its' axiomatisation something analogous
to the more significant part of the deduction theorem, as well as disjunction. The semantics of system P, to be outlined
in \Cref{subsubsection:preferential-interpretations}, are similar to the approach which was proposed by Shoham in
\cite{shohamSemanticApproach}.

Fortunately, the definition of a preferential consequence relation is almost identical to that of cumulative one, with
only the addition of the \textit{Or} postulate.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferential-relation}

	The consequence relation $\twiddle$ is a \emph{preferential consequence relation} if and only if it satisfies the properties
	of \emph{Reflexivity}, \emph{Left Logical Equivalence}, \emph{Right Weakening}, \emph{Cut}, \emph{Or}, and \emph{Cautious
	Monotony}.
\end{definition}

As a justification for \textit{Or}, consider that \textit{Normally, if Billy were abducted by aliens he would be traumatised},
but also \textit{Normally, if Billy witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden he would be traumatised}. If we learned that
either of these events took place, we should find it plausible to infer that Billy were traumatised.

\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Or}{\phi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \lor \psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

The addition of \textit{Or} to the rest of the properties of system C allow for useful derived rules. For instance, \textit{S}

\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{S}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \psi \rightarrow \gamma}
\end{align}

The derived rule \textit{S} is analogous to the deduction theorem (cf. \Cref{axiom:deduction-theorem}), and

\begin{lemma}[\cite{shohamSemanticApproach}]
	For $\phi, \psi \in \mathcal{L}$ and some valuation $u \in \mathcal{U}$, if $u \vdash \psi$ and $u \twiddle \phi$, then
	$u \twiddle \phi \land \psi$.
\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Preferential Interpretations}
\label{subsubsection:preferential-interpretations}

The semantics of system P provided by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic} are based on the \textit{preference
logics} proposed by Shoham \cite{shohamSemanticApproach}. The fundamental idea is that valuations, or \textit{worlds}, can
be ordered by a \textit{preference relation} so that one world being preferred to another is a normative claim that we
should consider deductions which hold in the preferred world---but may not in other worlds---as plausible.

It will be useful to recall some definitions from propositional logic: a valuation $u \in \mathcal{U}$ is a \textit{model}
of a formula $\phi \in \mathcal{L}$ if it satisfies $\phi$, $\phi$ is \textit{satisfiable} if it has a model. Another formula
$\psi$ is a \textit{logical consequence} of $\phi$ if the models of $\phi$ are a subset of the models of $\psi$.

We now introduce analogous definitions in the setting of preferential logic. The first change is that we consider a richer
language, $\Lang$, which is simply $\lang$ extended with the new connective `$\twiddle$' such that $\phi \twiddle \psi$ is
a sentence in $\Lang$ when $\phi, \psi \in \mathcal{L}$. It is easy to skip over, but usage of the `$\twiddle$' has now shifted
from an element of the metalanguage, where it refers to a kind of consequence relation, to an object level connective,
used analogously to the classical Boolean operator `$\rightarrow$'. Certain restrictions on the usage of `$\twiddle$' do
apply. In particular, the nesting of defeasible statements is not permitted, and so
$\phi \twiddle (\psi \twiddle \gamma )$ is not a statement in the language $\Lang$. At times, we may wish to distinguish
between formulae in $\Lang$ which do not use `$\twiddle$', and so we refer to these as classical, and the alternative as
defeasible formulae.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferential-interpretation} \index{non-monotonic reasoning! system P! preferential interpretation}

	A \emph{preferential interpretation} $\Pin$ is a triple where $S$ is a set of \emph{states}, $l: S \to \mathcal{U}$ is
	a function mapping states to valuations, and $\prec$ is a strict partial-order on $S$.
\end{definition}

The preference relation provides a basis for restricting ourselves to consider only those preferred worlds, which
represent a normal state of affairs. This idea is formalised as \textit{minimal states}:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:state-minimal}

	Given a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ and some $\phi \in \Lang$, we write $\underline{\hat{\phi}}$ to denote the set
	$\{s \in \hat{\phi}\mid \nexists s' \in \hat{\phi}\text{ such that }s' \prec s \}$, which is the set of \textit{preferred
	states} that satisfy $\phi$. We may also call these the \textit{$\phi$-minimal} states.
\end{definition}

It is necessary to stress the distinction between states in a preferential interpretation and valuations. There is no
requirement that the mapping from states to valuations be injective, and so the same valuation may appear many times in the
preference relation under distinct states. A corollary is that, given a finite set of valuations, the set of states may
be infinite. In turn, it is often required that the preference relation of a preferential interpretation satisfy the
\textit{smoothness} condition (which has also been called \textit{bounded} by Shoham \cite{shohamSemanticApproach}, or
\textit{stoppering} by Makinson \cite{makinson2003bridges}):

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:smoothness} \index{binary relation! smoothness}

	A preferential interpretation $\Pin$ is called \textit{smooth} if and only if for each $\phi \in \Lang$, and each
	state $s \in \hat{\phi}$ satisfying $\phi$, either $s \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$ or there exists another state $s' \in
	\hat{\phi}$ where $s' \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$.
\end{definition}

The smoothness condition is violated by preference relations which fail to satisfy transitivity, or where there are
infinite descending chains of more preferred states \cite{Schlechta1996}. The consequence relations of preferential interpretations
with non-smooth preference relations may fail to satisfy cautious monotony \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,makinson2003bridges}.
\textcolor{red}{give a demonstration of why}

The language $\Lang$ was introduced as the union of the standard propositional language $\lang$ and the language of
defeasible conditionals. There are, regrettably, distinct formulations of what it means for a preferential interpretation
to satisfy a classical or defeasible formula. For the classical case, we have:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:state-satisfaction}

	Given a preferential interpretation $\pin$, we say that a state $s \in S$ \emph{satisfies} a classical formula
	$\phi \in \Lang$ if and only if the valuation $l(s) \vDash \phi$. In this case, we write $\pin, s \vDash \phi$, and use
	$\hat{\phi}$ to denote the set $\{s \in S \mid \pin,s \vDash \phi \}$. Then, $\pin$ \textit{satisfies} $\phi$ if and
	only if $\pin , s \vDash \phi$ for all $s \in S$.
\end{definition}

What it means for a preferential interpretation to satisfy a classical formula is unsurprising, and corresponds to the idea
that the formula holds in every possible world. We are more interested in what it means for defeasible formulae to be
satisfied, and so we have:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferentially-satisfiable}

	A defeasible formula $\phi \twiddle \psi \in \Lang$ is \emph{satisfied} by a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ if and
	only if the every minimal state $s \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$ also satisfies $\psi$. In this case we write
	$\pin \VDash \phi \twiddle \psi$ and say that $\pin$ is a \emph{preferential model} of $\phi \twiddle \psi$.
\end{definition}

One pleasing perspective on the semantics of preferential consequence relations is that we require little in the way of
``new machinery''. Outside of the preference relation, satisfaction of a defeasible conditional behaves similarly to
satisfaction of classical formulae, only with a restricted consideration on states.

\begin{example}
	\label{example:preferential-interpretation}

	Consider the knowledge base
	\[
		\Delta = \big\{h \twiddle c,\; s \twiddle h, \; b \rightarrow \neg c \big\}
	\]

	containing both defeasible conditionals, as well as classical propositional formula. The knowledge base encodes the setting
	where \say{Humans normally experience time chronologically}, \say{Soldiers are normally human}, and \say{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time.}

		\caption{A preferential model of $\Delta$}
		\label{figure:preferential-interpretation}
	\end{figure}
	\Cref{figure:preferential-interpretation} demonstrates one model of $\Delta$. It is relatively easy to verify that
	each statement (classical and defeasible) in $\Delta$ is satisfied by the preferential interpretation. As a means of providing
	some intuition for the preceding discussion, we remind the reader of \Cref{lemma:cut-cautious}, which says that ``If $\phi
	\twiddle \psi$, then the plausible consequences of $\phi \land \psi$ coincide with those of just $\phi$.'' As we have a
	model of $h \twiddle c$, the plausible consequences of $h$ and $h \land c$ should coincide. This Lemma becomes quite apparent
	when it is recognised that the two sets $\underline{\hat{h}}$ and $\underline{\widehat{h \land c}}$ are precisely the same
	sets.
	% The example further gives a good intution for why transitivity fails. Again, the interpretation is a model of $s \twiddle
	% h$ and $h \twiddle c$. For transitivity to hold,
\end{example}

Within the context of preferential models, there is another treatment of classical formulae which allows for the discarding
of \Cref{definition:state-satisfaction} and a single notion of what it means for a preferential interpretation to be a model
of a formula in $\Lang$. The idea is to translate the hard-constraints of classical formulae to defeasible syntax.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:classical-to-defeasible}

	If $\phi$ is a classical formula in the language $\Lang$, then it can be expressed as the defeasible conditional $\neg
	\phi \twiddle \bot$. Then, any preferential interpretation $\pin$ is a model of $\phi$ if and only if it is a model of
	the defeasible conditional $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$.
\end{lemma}

To explain the mechanics behind \Cref{lemma:classical-to-defeasible}, consider that a preferential interpretation $\pin$
being a model of the conditional $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$ is equivalent to the $\neg \phi$-minimal states being a
subset of the states which satisfy $\bot$. Of course, $\bot$ represents logical falshood, and the set of states which satisfy
it is the emptyset. In turn, if $\pin$ is a model of $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$, there can be no states which satisfy
$\neg \phi$, which is equivalent to the condition that all states satisfy $\phi$. If $\phi$ is thought of as the
proposition \say{All men are mortal}, then the defeasible counterpart reads as \say{If not all men are mortal, then it is normal to infer anything, including a contradiction}
\cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what}.

We assume this treatment of classical formulae from this point onwards, and consolidate the notation as
$\pin \VDash \phi$ where $\phi \in \Lang$ is a defeasible conditional.

\textcolor{red}{maybe something about how without smoothness, we don't have CM}

\begin{theorem}[Soundness]
	\label{theorem:soundness-preferential}

	If $\Pin$ is a preferential interpretation and $\phi, \psi \in \Lang$, then $\pin$ defines the consequence relation $\twiddle
	_{\pin}$ given by the set $\{\phi \twiddle_{\pin}\psi \mid \pin \VDash \phi \twiddle \psi\}$, which satisfies \textit{Reflexivity},
	\textit{Left Logical Equivalence}, \textit{Right Weakening}, \textit{Or}, and \textit{Cautious Monotony} and is thus a
	preferential consequence relation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]
	\label{theorem:completeness-preferential}

	If $\twiddle_{P}$ is a preferential consequence relation, then there exists a preferential interpretation $W$ which induces
	the consequence relation $\twiddle_{W}$ such that $\twiddle_{P}$ is precisely $\twiddle_{W}$.
\end{theorem}

The decision to construct the preference relation on states which map to valuations, rather than valuations directly,
may seem arbitrary. Certainly, Shoham \cite{shohamSemanticApproach} makes no such distinction in his preferential logic.
However, Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic} provide an example, apty described as ``en pessant'' by
Bezzazi \cite{Bezzazi1997}, which shows that it is necessary in the setting of preferential consequence relations. The example
shows a preferential consequence relation generated by a preferential interpretation where the function mapping states to
valuations is not injective. It is then shown that there is no injective counterpart which gives rise to an equivalent
consequence relation.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:states-preferential}

	There exists a non-injective preferential interpretation $\pin$ which defines the consequence relation
	$\twiddle_{\pin}$ such that no injective preferential interpretation defines the same consequence relation.
\end{lemma}

\Cref{figure:duplicate-states-example} shows a portion of the preferential interpretation in \Cref{example:preferential-interpretation}.
The states $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are duplicate states, specifically they both map to the valuation $\{s,h,\overline{c}\}$.
As before, this prefrential interpretation is a model of $s \twiddle h$ as the set of minimal $s$-states,
$\{s_{2},s_{3}\}$, is a subset of the $h$-states.

% Consider the more finely grained portion of the preferential interpretation in \Cref{figure:preferential-interpretation}.
% As before, the interpretation is a model of the conditional $s \twiddle h$. It is not, however, a model of $s \twiddle c$
% given that $s_{2}$, a duplicate state to $s_{1}$, is a minimal state satisfying $s$ which does not satisfy $c$.

	\caption{The \textit{en pessant} argument for allowing non-injective interpretations}
	\label{figure:duplicate-states-example}
\end{figure}

The interpretation is not a model of the conditional $s \twiddle c$, due to the counter-example of $s_{2}$ being a
typical soldier who does not experience chronological time. Should $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ be merged, the result would be an
interpretation which is a model of $s\twiddle c$; that is, a distinct consequence relation.

\subsection{Preferential Entailment}
\label{subsection:preferential-entailment}

Equipped with definitions for the class of preferential relations and a representation theorem that relates these to a corresponding
semantics in the form of preferential interpretations, it is appropriate to discuss the matter of \textit{preferential
entailment}, or \textit{p-entailment}.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:p-entailment}

	A defeasible knowledge base $\Delta$ \textit{preferentially entails} a defeasible conditional $\phi \in \Lang$ if and only
	if $\phi$ is satisfied by every preferential model of $\Delta$, in this case we write $\Delta \dentails_{p}\phi$. The set
	of all defeasible conditionals that can be preferentially entailed from $\Delta$ is denoted by $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$ and is
	called the \textit{preferential closure} of $\Delta$.
\end{definition}

The definition provided for p-entailment is worryingly similar to the Tarskian idea of logical consequence, which was described
in \Cref{subsection:logical-consequence}. It is ``worrying'' in the sense that Tarskian consequence is monotonic, and we
are interested in non-monotonic entailment relations. Indeed, our fear is justified: If we consider the set of
preferential models of a defeasible knowledge base $\Delta$, then the set of conditionals they all agree on is exactly the
preferential closure, $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$. The addition of another conditional to our knowledge base, resulting in
$\Delta \cup \{\phi \}$, only serves to reduce consideration to those models of $\Delta$ that also satisfy $\phi$.
Within this restricted set of models, the consensus on $\Cn{p}(\Delta )$ remains. Formally, we have:
\begin{align}
	\Delta \subseteq \Delta \cup \{\phi\} \quad \textit{implies}\quad \Cn{p}(\Delta) \subseteq \Cn{p}(\Delta \cup \{ \phi \})
\end{align}
which tells us that p-entailment is monotonic

There is room for some (justified) confusion here. After all we have carefully avoided satisfying otherwise useful
properties which imply monotonicity, only to end up with precisely that. Despite the monotonicity of p-entailment, system
P displays non-monotonic behaviour on the object level and so, we are able to express the non-monotonic pattern of
reasoning that while normally humans experience time chronologically, Billy Pilgrim, who is a human, experiences non-chronological
time. In many cases, this is sufficient.

% \begin{theorem}
% 	\label{theorem:preferential-compactness} If $\phi$ is a singular, and $\Delta$ a set of defeasible conditionals in
% 	$\Lang$, then the following equivalency holds:
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item The set $\Delta$ p-entails $\phi$; or, $\Delta \dentails_{p}\phi$

% 		\item There is a finite sequence consisting of the properties satisfied by preferential relations from $\Delta$ to $\phi$.
% 	\end{enumerate}
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{corollary}
% 	\label{corollary:monotonocity-preferential-entailment} The preferential closure $\Delta^{p}$ of a set $\Delta$ of defeasible
% 	conditionals is a preferential consequence relation, and therefore has a preferential model $\pin$ that satisfies
% 	exactly every statement in $\Delta^{p}$.
% \end{corollary}

% RE iT not being nmr We are willing to accept these credulous inferences precisely because they may be retracted we may withdraw
% previous inferences under learning new facts.

\section{Rational Consequence}
\label{section:rational-consequence}

\subsection{Rational Consequence Relations}
\label{subsection:rational-consequence-relations}

We now discuss a subset of preferential consequence relations which satisfy the additional property of \textit{rational
monotony}.

\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Rational Monotony}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \ntwiddle \neg \gamma}{\phi \land \gamma \twiddle \psi}
\end{align}

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:rational-relation}

	The consequence relation $\twiddle$ is a \emph{rational consequence relation} if and only if it satisfies the properties
	of \emph{Reflexivity}, \emph{Left Logical Equivalence}, \emph{Right Weakening}, \emph{Cut}, \emph{Or}, \emph{Cautious
	Monotony}, and \emph{Rational Monotony}.
\end{definition}

Rational monotony is the most contested of the KLM postulates. It describes the pattern of reasoning where, from the
perspective of knowing $\phi$, if one normally accepts $\psi$ but not $\neg \gamma$, then confirming $\gamma$ should not
cause the retraction of any plausible inferences that were possible from the original perspective. Essentially, if
$\gamma$ is consistent with what is presently known, then we can still reason monotonically with its addition.

Stalnaker \cite{Stalnaker1994,sep-logic-nonmonotonic-Stanford} provides an argument against accepting rational monotony.
The objection is that rational monotony commits us to make inferences when the more reasonable position is to remain
undecided. Paraphrasing, we are asked to consider three composers: \textit{Verdi}, who is believed to be Italian, and
\textit{Satie} and \textit{Bizet}, who are believed to be French. If it were learned that Verdi and Bizet were
compatriots, then it seems reasonable that the conclusion that either of them are French or Italian is indeterminate.
What is reasonable, however, is to maintain the belief that Satie is French.\footnote{We will use some syntax from
predicate logic, this is merely an aid to make Stalnaker's example clearer.}
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}
The argument proceeds by considering that Verdi and Satie may too be compatriots. Since Verdi's nationality is now unknown,
we are no longer equipped to reject the plausibility of the new compatriotship, and so
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\ntwiddle \neg \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie)}
\end{align}
The two conditions of rational monotony have been met, and so the following inference should continue to hold
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\land \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie)}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}

The issue, as Stalnaker sees it, is that rational monotony forces the inference Satie is still French, and by their
compatriotship, so are Bizet and Verdi. The ``correct'' thing to do in this scenario is to remain uncertain about which
nationality they all share.

However, the result Stalnaker objects to is dependent his particular construction of this problem, rather than being
intrinsic to rational monotony. The second condition for rational monotony, that $\phi \ntwiddle \neg \gamma$, makes no requirement
about the syntactic structure of $\gamma$ outside of it being a formula in the language. In the example, Stalnaker could
just as easily have written
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet,Verdi)}\ntwiddle \neg (\neg \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie))}
\end{align}
meaning that it is not expected that Verdi and Satie are compatriots, to which we can apply an instance of rational
monotony, from which we are not forced to believe that all three composers are French.
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\land \neg(\texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie))}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}

Rational monotony represents a significantly stronger form of monotonicity than cautious monotony. Under cautious
monotony, monotonic behaviour is restricted to scenarios where the new information was already expected. Rational
monotony goes further, allowing monotonic behaviour when the new information was merely not contradictory to our beliefs
\cite{sep-logic-nonmonotonic-Stanford}. That is, cautious monotony is phrased as ``From the presence of these beliefs,
we plausibly infer the following.'' While rational monotony can be phrased as ``From the presence of this belief, and
the absence of this belief, we may infer the following.''

\textcolor{red}{How do we make a decision on rational monotonicity. How does it resolve}

Consider the following, more favourable, example demonstrating why we should accept rational monotony. At a university
where it is normal (i.e., expected or typical) for students to graduate, Alice and Charlie are normal students, and so
they will graduate. Alice is also widely regarded as a clever student. Bob, a third student who, despite being clever, is
known to his professors as being unprecedentedly lazy. As a result of failing to appear for his final examinations, Bob will
not graduate.

Given that Alice is a normal student who is also clever, from a careful reading it becomes evident that our set of facts
does not commit us to the position where normal students are expected to not be clever, nor does it---considering Charlie---explicitly
endorse the position that normal students are clever. The ``cleverness'' of normal students is indeterminate. Rational monotony
tells us that we should then feel secure to make the inference that normal, clever students will continue to graduate (the
dual of normal, non-clever students would too continue to graduate).

Preferential interpretations, as shown below, do not guarantee this kind of reasoning.

\end{figure}

The culprit, however, is quite easy to spot. Despite not being a normal student, the preference relation in
\Cref{subfigure:not-rational} allows Bob to be a normal, clever student. On the other hand, the argument behind the preference
relation in \Cref{subfigure:rational} might be that \say{All normal students should be explicitly preferred to non-normal students.}

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:modular-order} \index{partial-order! modular}

	A partial order $\prec$ on the set $X$ is \emph{modular} if and only if for any incomparable $x,y \in X$ when $z \prec
	x$ then also $z \prec y$.
\end{definition}

A \textit{modular} partial order can be regarded as partitioning the set of states into equivalence classes and defining
over the equivalence relation. Then, all members of an equivalence class are considered to have the same degree of typicality,
but are also comparable to any element not in their partition \cite{GinsberCounterfactuals}. We now introduce \textit{ranked
interpretations}:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:ranked-interpretation}

	A \emph{ranked interpretation} is a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ where the preference relation $\prec$ is \emph{modular}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:modular-ranking-function}

	If $\prec$ is a modular partial order on $X$ then there is a \emph{ranking function} $\mathsf{r}\colon X \to \Omega$,
	with $\Omega$ being a totally ordered set for which the strict order is denoted $<$, such that if $x \prec y$ then $\mathsf{r}
	(x) < \mathsf{r}(y)$ for any $x,y \in X$.
\end{lemma}

Ranked interpretations constitute a specific type of preferential interpretation. The modular structure of the preference
relation enables their representation as a stratified system of equivalence classes, otherwise: \textit{ranks}. Elements
within the same rank are treated as equally preferred. The preference relation can be encoded by assigning each rank an
ordinal, usually the natural numbers are used.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={circle, fill=black, inner sep=0.5pt, minimum size=1.5mm}]
		\draw[rounded corners=10pt, line width=0.1mm] (0,2) rectangle (4,0);
		\draw[rounded corners=10pt, line width=0.1mm] (0,1) -- (4,1);
		\node[fill=none] (0) at (0.5,0.5) [] {$0$};
		\node[fill=none] (1) at (0.5,1.5) [] {$1$};
		\draw (1,0) -- (1,2);
		\node[fill=none] (alice) at (1.8,0.5) [] {$\{c,g,s\}$};

		\node[fill=none] (bob) at (2.5,1.5) [] {$\{c,s\}$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{A depiction of a ranked interpretation}
\end{figure}

A second, less superficial, departure is that \Cref{lemma:states-preferential} does not hold in the context of ranked
interpretations and rational consequence relations. This follows directly from modularity, as the en pessant style
arguments, discussed earlier, are avoided by modularity. This allows the elements which populate the ranks of a ranked interpretation
to be valuations directly, rather than states. The definition of a ranked interpretation can then be drastically simplified:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:ranked-interpretation-real}

	A \emph{ranked interpretation} is a function $\mathsf{r}\colon \mathcal{U}\to \mathbb{N}\cup \{ \infty \}$ where there
	are no ``gaps'' between ranks.
\end{definition}

1. I sometimes use "billy pilgrim" in monospace font (this is a proposition), then when I'm refer to a more general/verbose description of the scenario I use Billy Pilgrim without monospace font. I think this is fine, as the context is fairly clear. Just would like confirmation.
2. Referencing [pp. X][9] or just [9].
3. Should I have a glossary for symbols
    a) Should I also have an index for defintions/theorems/lemmas?
    b) Separate to the index for concepts (i.e. Partial Order pg 3)

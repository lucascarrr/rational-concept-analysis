\chapter{Non-monotonic Reasoning in FCA}
\label{chapter:defeasible-reasoning-in-fca}

The conlcusion of \Cref{part:1} marks the end of the scaffolding
component of this work. The remaining chapters are devoted to the
introduction and subsequent discussion of the more novel
contributions we make. Namely, the unification of the ideas presented
in
\Cref{chapter:formal-concept-analysis,chapter:defeasible-reasoning}.
That is, to introduce an approach to do the KLM style of
non-monotonic reasoning in FCA. Fortunately, as will become apparent
as this chapter progresses, the setting of FCA may be quite naturally
extended to accomodate the necessary semantics.

This chapter draws on two publications, \cite{Carr2024} and
\cite{Carr2025}.

\section{Motivation}
\label{section:motivation}

We begin this unification by providing justification for why it may
be desirable to extend FCA to support non-monotonicity to begin with.
There are certain properties of FCA that are substantially undermined
by violations of monotonicity. For instance, one central notion of
concept lattices is that they describe chains of inheritance between
concepts and their sub-concepts. The ability to preserve these
inheritance chains becomes tenuous under non-monotonic semantics, as
they are essentially a form of transitivity, which has already been
shown not to hold in KLM–style reasoning.

That being said, there are indeed compelling arguments that the
presence of monotonicity in FCA has similarly undesirable
second-order effects. These are somewhat similar to those given in
\Cref{section:nmr-background}, but phrased from a different
perspective. The perspective change stems from the dissimilarity
between the starting point of the usual KLM setting and the starting
point of FCA. In the former, one begins with a knowledge base of
implications, to which new rules are added. The addition of new
information may result in tension between deductions, which provides
the motivation for defeasible reasoning. In contrast, the starting
point of FCA usually begins with a formal context, which is presumed
to be static. One task is then to perform a kind of rule learning of
attribute implications, to discover corrpondence between attributes.

In the classical setting, only those attribute corrpondences which
are total, meaning they admit no counter examples, can be found. To
recognise that this implies monotonicity, suppose the rule
$(\texttt{Beige} \rightarrow \texttt{Shade})$ were accpeted. Then
every object which had the attribute \texttt{Beige} also has
\texttt{Shade}, by extension, every object that has \texttt{Beige}
and \textit{something else} will continue to have \texttt{Shade}. In certain cases, this imposes too strong an impediment on the amount
of useful information that may be extract from a context. Certainly,
there are instances of meaningful correspondence between attributes
which admit exceptions. Herein lies the first motivation for
introducing KLM style reasoning to FCA. A second argument, consdering
how the benefits of being able to reason prototypically about
concepts is presented in the next chapter, where it is more relevant.

Consider \Cref{cxt:lichens} below, which describes several distinct
species of lichen, described by certain morphological and ecological
properties.

	\caption{A formal context of lichens} \label{fig:lichens}
\end{figure}

\textit{Lichens} are quite interesting organisms: a symbiosis between
a fungus and an alga \cite{zonca2022lichens}.

The \textit{thallus} is comprised from an ascomycete fungus and
filaments, or \textit{hyphae}, containing chlorophyll possesing cells
that enable the organism to feed itself.

Previously considered plants, or secretions from plants. Frequently,
mistaken to be parisitic, but their substrate is purely for
affixation, lichens draw no nutrition.

\subsection{Association Rules}
\label{subsection:association-rules}

Concerns over brittleness in the semantics of (classical) attribute
implications are well known in the FCA literature, and in data mining
more generally \cite{Lakhal2005}. \textit{Association rules} are able
express implication-like statements despite the existence of
counterexamples in the data, or in our case a context. These are
statements like \say{$66\%$ of the members of congress who were
	\textit{Democrats}, which makes up $50\%$ of congress, voted on the
	\textit{MX-Missile} bill}.

The \emph{support} of a set of attributes $X \subseteq M$ in a
context $\GMI$ is the fraction of objects which have all attributes
$X$ over the total number of objects; and so $\mathrm{supp}( X) =
	\nicefrac{|X^{\downarrow}|}{|G|}$, the (relative) support of a rule
$A \Rightarrow B$ is simply the support of $A$. The
\textit{confidence} of a rule is a measure of how frequently the
premise and conclusion occur, relative to how frequently the premise
occurs, formally $\mathrm{conf}(A \Rightarrow B) =
	\nicefrac{\mathrm{supp}(X \cup Y)}{\mathrm{supp}(X)}$. In the example
above, the support of the rule is $50\%$ and its confidence is
$66\%$. Association rules which meet specified lower-thresholds for
support and confidence are then accepted.

While association rules present a reasonable solution to the problem
of discovering and representing implications with exceptions, there
are some undesirable qualities. Settling on the threshold vallues for
support and confidence is usually dependent on human input, and there
is no obvious intuition for how one might arrive at these.
Frequently, it is a requirement to know the data well, which creates
a kind of circularity as the purpose of this work is to extend a tool
which helps one understand their data.

The situation gets worse when we try to describe the properties of
reasoning with association rules. Consider the two rules below, which
should be accepted with $\mathrm{minconf}= 0.6$ and $\mathrm{minsup}=
	0.5$.

\begin{align*}
	\texttt{dem}\Rightarrow \texttt{mxm} \\
	% ; \text{with}\; \mathrm{Sup}= 0.5 \; \text{and}\; \mathrm{Conf}= 0.66 \\
	\texttt{dem}\Rightarrow \texttt{dfe} % \; \text{with}\; \mathrm{Sup}= 0.5 \; \text{and}\; \mathrm{Conf}= 0.66
\end{align*}
In natural language, we might summarise this scenario as saying
\say{Democrats voted in favour of the \textit{MX-Missile} and
	\textit{Duty-Free Exports}}. To make future analysis simpler, we
could suggest that whenever we accept association rules of the form
\begin{align*}
	\phi \Rightarrow \psi \\
	\phi \Rightarrow \gamma,
\end{align*}
we may compress the information as the simpler representation:
\begin{align*}
	\phi \Rightarrow \psi \land \gamma
\end{align*}

Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In the above scenario,
the rule $\texttt{dem}\Rightarrow \{\texttt{mxm,dfe}\}$ has a
confidence of $0.47$, which is below the $\mathrm{minconf}$
threshold.

That the pattern of reasoning enforced by association rules does not
satisfy the above characterisation---which is the same property as
was discussed at \Cref{postulate:and}---may be overlooked in
isolation. The more general problem is that association rules do not
admit description via \lucas{the kind of axiomisation we want [source
			needed]}.

\section{Preferential Contexts}
\label{section:preferential-contexts}

We begin the introduction of KLM style defeasible reasoning to FCA by
defining a structure that is in almost perfect analogy to
preferential interpretations. The analogy is not perfect as we
initially behave quite conservatively, and attempt to make as few
changes to the default setting of FCA as possible. As we get further
along in the discussion, more substantial amendments to the default
setting are suggested, these will serve to complete the analogy. The
idea behind the order of this exposition is that we view this work
largely as extending FCA with ideas borrowed from defeasible
reasoning. Then, there may be those who find some of the essential
parts of defeasible reasoning quite useful in FCA, but wish to remain
in the default setting.

With that said, we define the first extension of a
\textit{preferential context}.
\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferential-context}
	\index{formal context! preferential context}

	A \emph{preferential context} $\pcontext = \PGMI$ is a formal context
	$\GMI$ where $\prec$ is a strict partial order, or \emph{preference
		order}, on the set of objects.
\end{definition}

Preferential contexts, albeit with a different motivation, were first
introduced by Obiedkov \shortcite{Obiedkov2012} and later, with our
purposes in mind, by Carr \textit{et al.} \shortcite{Carr2024}. In
some sense they are nothing more than a formal context with the
addition of a preference order over the set of objects. The same
understanding of preference orders on states applies, and so for two
objects $g_1, g_2 \in G$, when $g_1 \prec g_2$, we say that object
$g_1$ is \textit{preferred} or \textit{more typical} than $g_2$.

An example of what such a preference ordering might look like is
given below (in the interests of brevity, we consider only a
subcontext of \Cref{cxt:lichens}, constructed by taking the first six
objects).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{A preference relation on a subcontext of \Cref{fig:lichens}}
	\label{figure:preference-relation-lichen}
\end{figure}

Recall that preferential interpretations were defined by a relation
on states, which were subsequently mapped to valuations, with no
requirement that the mapping be injective. That is, the same
valuation could appear in multiple ``locations'' in the preference
order. It may then be surprising that states see have been entirely
omitted from our definition of preferential contexts. The reason is
slightly informal and based on the recognition that, unlike the set
of propositional valuations, formal contexts have no restriction on
the inclusion of distinct objects with equivalent intensions. In
fact, this is quite common. If need be, one may quite naturally avoid
the issue arising from duplicate states introduced in
\Cref{lemma:states-preferential}.

% \begin{lemma}
% 	\label{lemma:objects-preferential}
%
% 	There exists a preferential context $\pcontext = \PGMI$ where there exist two objects, $g,h \in G$, with
% 	$g^{\uparrow}= h^{\uparrow}$ that defines the consequence relation $\twiddle_{\pin}$ such that no
% 	preferential context $\pcontext'$ without `duplicate' objects defines the same relation.
% \end{lemma}

Under the preference relation, we describe the $\prec$-minimal states
as one might expect, through the process of \textit{minimisation}.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:minimisation}

	In a preferential context $\pcontext = \PGMI$, the
	\emph{minimisation} of a set $A \subseteq G$ is defined by
	\[
		\underline{A}\coloneqq \{\, g \in A \mid \nexists h \in A : (h \prec g) \,\}.
	\]
\end{definition}

Frequently, the starting point of a minimisation is not directly from
a set of objects, and is rather applied to a set of objects that is
itself the result of a prior derivation of attributes. That is, we
might begin with the attribute set $\{\,\texttt{soil}\,\}$ and wish
to find the most preferred objects that have this attribute. We call
this the \textit{minimised-derivation}, and write
$\Mind{\{\,\texttt{soil}\,\}}$. If one were to apply a second
derivation to the set resulting from a minimised-derivation, the
result would represent all those attributes shared by the preferred
objects that were in the minimised-derivation from the initial set of
attributes. In turn, we refer to this as \textit{minimised-return}
and write $\Minr{\{\,\texttt{soil}\,\}}$.

The minimised-derivation of $\{\,\texttt{soil}\,\}$ yields the
singleton object-set \{\texttt{Caeruleum terricola}\}. One
interpretation of this might be that \texttt{Caeruleum terricola} has
some soil-substrate related property which sets it apart from other
species of lichen which also possess a soil-substrate. The point is
subtle, but this reasoning that informs this interpretation is not
true in general. The status of \texttt{Caeruleum terricola} as the
uniquely preferred species of lichens which have a soil-substrate may
well be the byproduct of another preference, entirely unrelated to
substrates. For example, \Cref{figure:preference-relation-lichen} may
be an encoding of the preference that \say{lichens which tolerate
	indirect light are more preferable than those which tolerate direct
	light; from those less-preferrable species which do tolerate direct
	light, it is preferred that they are orange}. These preferences would
construct the same ordering on objects, but clearly has a distinct
interpretation to that which was proposed previously. This remark is
of little material significance, but is rather important for
preventing misconceptions about what preference orders represent, and
provides some intuition for how they might be constructed. For the
time being, we remain agnostic to the latter question about their
construct. This will be the subject of
\Cref{subsubsection:finding-order}.

Our motivation for introducing preferential contexts is quite
apparent: their structural properties can be used to provide a
semantics for defeasible attribute implications, which we refer to as
\textit{defeasible conditionals}. If $X,Y \subseteq M$ are sets of
attributes, then the expression $X \twiddle Y$ tells us that the
typical extension of $X$ is contained in the extension of $Y$.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:satisfaction-preferential-context}

	Let $\pcontext = \PGMI$ be a preferential context, $A,B \subseteq M$
	subsets of attributes, and $A \twiddle B$ \emph{defeasible
		conditional}. We say that $A \twiddle B$ is \emph{satisfied} by
	$\pcontext$ if and only if $\Mind{A}\subseteq B^{\downarrow}$, then
	we write $\pcontext \vDash_{\pcontext}A \twiddle B$.
\end{definition}

The condition for satisfaction of $A \twiddle B$ is that all the
objects in the minimised-derivation of $A$ are members of the
derivation of . For those with a background in FCA, satisfaction may
be expressed more familiarly as $B \subseteq \Minr{A}$.

\begin{example}

	The following defeasible conditionals are all satisfied by the
	preferential context composed from \Cref{cxt:lichens} with the
	preference order from \Cref{figure:preference-relation-lichen}.

	\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
		\item $\{\texttt{high-light}\} \twiddle \{\texttt{red}\}$
		\item $\{\texttt{high-light,low-moisture}\} \ntwiddle \{\texttt{red}\}$
		\item $\{\texttt{high-light, yellow}\} \twiddle \{\texttt{orange}\}$
		\item $\{\texttt{orange}\} \twiddle \{\texttt{red}\}$
		\item $\{\texttt{high-light,yellow}\} \ntwiddle \{\texttt{red}\}$
	\end{enumerate}

	These conditionals convey that usually species of lichen that live in
	areas with a signficant amount of light are red, but those which
	additionally live in areas with low-moisture usually are not red.
	While it is typical for yellow species of lichen that live in
	well-lit areas to also be orange, and it is also typical for orange
	species of lichen to have red colouring too, it does not follow that
	yellow species of lichen living in well-lit areas have red. In other
	words, the logic is non-monotonic and intransitive.
\end{example}

% It might be suspected that the kind of reasoning described by preferential contexts corresponds to the
% preferential consequence relations discussed earlier. We show that this is not quite true.

% \begin{theorem}
% 	\label{theorem:preferential-context-partial-soundness}

% 	The consequence relation $\twiddle_{\pcontext}$ induced by a preferential context $\PGMI$ satisfies
% 	\textit{Reflexivity, Left-logical equivalence, Right weakening, And,} and \textit{Cautious Monotony}.
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{proof}
% 	\label{proof:preferential-context-partial-soundness}

% 	Let $\pcontext = \PGMI$ be a preferential context, and $A,B,C,D \subseteq M$ sets of attributes.

% 	For \textit{Reflexivity}, it needs to be shown that $\pcontext \vDash A \twiddle A$, equivalently that
% 	$\Mind{A}\subseteq A^{\downarrow}$. This holds by definition of the minimal-derivation operator. \lucas{Make
% 		sure this holds if $A^{\downarrow}= \emptyset$}

% 	For \textit{Left-logical equivalence}, if $\pcontext \vDash_{\pcontext}A \twiddle C$ and $A = B$, then
% 	$\pcontext \vDash_{\pcontext}B \twiddle C$. Assume that $\pcontext \vDash A \twiddle C$ and $A = B$ (by usual
% 	set equality). By this assumption, (i) $\Mind{A}\subseteq C^{\downarrow}$ and (ii) $\Mind{A}= \Mind{B}$ both
% 	hold. It is then clear that we can make the substitution that results in $\Mind{B}\subseteq C^{\downarrow}$,
% 	which is equivalent to $\pcontext \vDash B \twiddle C$.

% 	For \textit{Right weakening} we show that if $\pcontext \vDash A \rightarrow B, B \twiddle C$ then $\pcontext
% 		\vDash A \twiddle C$.
% \end{proof}

% The failure to satisfy the \textit{Or} postulate is due more to a technical point than a counter example. The
% assumed setting, of FCA's attribute logic, is restricted to definite Horn clauses, and therefore not
% sufficiently expressive for either negation or disjunction. We may address this issue by consdering a more
% expressive variant of attribute logic: the compound attributes discussed in
% \Cref{subsection:compound-attributes}. A minimal change is to simply extend the language of defeasible
% conditionals to compound attributes; since these more expressive formulae are constructed from a (normal) set
% of attributes, the definition of a preferential context remains the same.

% \begin{definition}
% 	\label{definition:defeasible-conditionals-compound}

% 	Let $\pcontext = \PGMI$ be a preferential context. Then $\phi \twiddle \psi$ where $\phi,\psi \in M^{+}$ is a
% 	\emph{defeasible conditional} over the compound attributes of $M$.
% \end{definition}

% We re-emphasize the point, which was originally made in \Cref{section:klm-framework}, that although the
% formulae that make up the antecedent and consequent of a defeasible conditional $\phi \twiddle \psi$ are in
% the language $M^{+}$, they are not themselves allowed to be defeasible conditionals. Thus, nesting of
% defeasible conditionals—expressions such as $\phi \twiddle \gamma \twiddle \psi$—is not permitted.
% Fortunately, with the relatively minor extension of compound attributes, the logic is sufficiently expressive
% for disjunction, and so we construct the following representation result.

% \begin{theorem}
% 	\label{theorem:preferential-context-soundness}

% 	The consequence relation $\twiddle_{\pcontext}$ induced by a preferential context $\pcontext = \PGMI$ with
% 	defeasible conditionals over the compound attributes of $M$ is a preferential consequence relation.
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{proof}
% 	\label{proof:preferential-context-soundness}
% \end{proof}

% \begin{theorem}
% 	\label{theorem:preferential-context-completeness}

% 	Let $\twiddle_{P}$ be an arbitrary preferential consequence relation over compound attributes $M^{+}$. Then
% 	there exists a preferential context $\pcontext = \PGMI$ inducing the consequence relation
% 	$\twiddle_{\pcontext}$ such that $\twiddle_{P}$ is precisely $\twiddle_{\pcontext}$.
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{proof}

% 	\label{proof:preferential-context-completeness}
% \end{proof}

% \begin{proposition}
% 	\label{proposition:preferential-context-irrational}

% 	Preferential contexts do not satisfy rational monotony.
% \end{proposition}

% % \begin{example} \label{example:counter-example-rationality} \end{example}

% \begin{definition}
% 	\label{definition:ranked-context}

% 	A \emph{ranked context} $\rcontext$ is a preferential context $\RGMI$ where the preference relation

% \end{definition}

% \subsubsection{Finding Order}
% \label{subsubsection:finding-order}

% Thus far, the discussion on finding a suitable preference relation has been omitted. It is a non-trivial task

% \section{Entailment}
% \subsection{Contextual Rational Closure}

% \begin{definition}

% 	A conditional $A \twiddle B$ \emph{rationally follows} from a set $\mathcal{T}$ of conditionals if and only
% 	if $\mathbb{T}, \mathcal{T}\dentails A \twiddle B$, where $\mathbb{T}$ is the \emph{test context}. It
% 	\emph{contextually follows} when $\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}\dentails A \rightarrow B$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}

% 	A set $\mathcal{T}$ is \emph{closed} with respect to a pair if and only if it contains every conditional that
% 	is rationally entailed. That is, if $\mathcal{T}= \{A \twiddle B \mid A,B \subseteq M \tand
% 		\mathbb{T},\mathcal{T}\dentails A \twiddle B\}$. $\mathcal{T}$ is \emph{contextually closed} if it contains
% 	every conditional that is contextually entailed, i.e. $\mathcal{T}= \{A \twiddle B \mid A,B \subseteq M \tand
% 		\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{T}\dentails A \rightarrow B\}$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}

% 	A set $\mathcal{T}$ of conditionals is \emph{rationally complete} with respect to $\mathbb{T},\Delta$ if and
% 	only if every conditional that is in the rational closure of $\mathbb{T}, \Delta$ rationally follows from
% 	$\mathcal{T}$, i.e., $\mathbb{T},\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathbb{T}, \Delta$ define the same entailment relation.
% \end{definition}
% Is it possible to find a$\mathcal{T}$such that$\mathcal{T}$is a compact form of$\Delta$. I.e., it should
% produce the same ranking on$\mathbb{T}$.

% \begin{definition}

% 	A set $\mathcal{T}$ of conditionals is \emph{contextually complete} with respect to $\mathbb{R}, \Delta$ if
% 	and only if every implication that is in the contextual closure of $\mathbb{R}, \Delta$ rationally follows
% 	from $\mathcal{T}$.
% \end{definition}

% A set of conditionals that is contextually complete to a ranked context$\mathbb{R}$and constraint
% set$\Delta$provides abstracted perspective, in terms of defeasible conditionals, on the information contained
% in the pair$(\mathbb{R}, \Delta )$. It is now the goal, as was done in
% \Cref{subsubsection:implication-bases}, to find such a set that is non-redundant, or the \textit{rational
% 	basis}of$(\mathbb{R},\Delta)$.

% \begin{definition}
% 	\label{definition:defeasible-closure}

% 	Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a set of defeasible conditionals over $M$. The operator $X \mapsto \Cn{\twiddle}(X)$
% 	given by $X \cup \{Y \subseteq M \mid X \twiddle Y\}$ is called the \emph{defeasible closure} of $X$. It is
% 	idempotent, extensive, and non-monotonic.

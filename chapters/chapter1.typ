= Mathematical Preliminaries 

This chapter is intended to serve as a reference point, clarifying ideas and notation, for the more fundamental concepts that will be used throughout the remainder of this dissertation. In the first section we discuss order and lattice theory. The third and final section introduces propositional logic, as well more general ideas in logic.

== Order and Lattice Theory

=== Orders

A _binary relation_ $R$ over the sets $X$ and $Y$ is a set of ordered pairs such

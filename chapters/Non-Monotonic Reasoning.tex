\chapter{Defeasible Reasoning}
\label{chapter:defeasible-reasoning}

Non-monotonicity in logical systems has been the focus of study for decades, and several distinct formalisms have been developed. The
motivation is to expand the inference power beyond that of the classical, to a more credulous one. This work is primarily interested in non-monotonic
reasoning following the preferential semantics introduced by Shoham \cite{shohamSemanticApproach}, for which there is a well-developed model
theory which further benefits from an obvious analogue to notions central to FCA. In particular, we are interested in the framework put forward
by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what}, frequently initialised to the `KLM framework'.

In the proceeding, we provide a background on non-monotonic reasoning in general, before introducing the KLM framework. We assume all the same
conventions introduced in \Cref{section:propositional-logic} for the technical discussions which occur in this chapter.

\section{Background on Non-monotonic Reasoning}
\label{section:nmr-background} Near the end of the previous chapter, the matter of consequence was discussed in a very formal sense. It is perhaps
helpful to distinguish this subject---classical consequence---from the common concept, as the former yields some surprising results which do
not appear at all congruent with how a person, or otherwise intelligent agent should reason \cite{tarski1936consequence, kraus1990nonmonotonic}.
For a demonstration of a result which may be \textit{surprising} in this way, consider the following propositions:
\vspace{1em}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\texttt{human}\rightarrow \texttt{chronological time}$

  \item $\texttt{soldier}\rightarrow \texttt{human}$

  \item $\texttt{billy pilgrim}\rightarrow \neg \texttt{chronological time}$
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{1em}

Knowing these propositions, if we were to encounter an individual in fatigues we might find it sensible---by propositions 2 and 1---to infer
that the individual experienced time chronologically. If we were to later learn that the individual was, in fact, Billy Pilgrim, given proposition
3, we should like to retract our prior inference, replacing it with the knowledge that the individual does not experience time chronologically.

Such recourse is not, as it stands, possible: When we see the that the individual is a soldier, the possible worlds satisfying our knowledge
are reduced to the single model: $\{\overline{b},c,h,s\}$ (where $b$: \texttt{billy pilgrim}, $c$: \texttt{chronological time}, $h$: \texttt{human},
and $s$: \texttt{soldier}). Should we later learn that the individual is indeed Billy Pilgrim, the theory becomes inconsistent.
%TODO: Add section in preliminaries about principle of explosion
And, by the principle of explosion, discussed in \Cref{subsection:logical-consequence}, our theory now entails that the individual experiences
time both chronologically and non-chronologically; indeed our theory entails everything and is accordingly worthless.

This property of classical logic---that adding new information never results in retraction of pre-existing knowledge---is called
monotonicity. Monotonicity requires that when we make a claim like \say{humans experience time chronologically}, we must be absolutely sure of
ourselves, so as to never worry about needing to retract an inference. This is, of course, too strict a requirement as we cannot determine for
all future, present, and past humans if it were the case that they experienced time chronologically. If we remain in the classical realm, it
seems our only options are to abandon our original claim or risk explosion.

At this point it is a good idea to provide some clarification on how we might begin to approach this issue. Continuing with the same example---and
continuing to allow ourselves to entertain the possibility of experiencing non-chronological time---it would certainly be agreed that
typically soldiers are human, and also that typically humans experience time chronologically. To resolve that Billy Pilgrim is a soldier, and
therefore a human, who does not experience chronological time, we need only to point out that he is an atypical human.

To make the previous paragraph more formal, we remind the reader of the discussion held around \Cref{definition:logical-consequence}: A formula
$\phi$ is a logical consequence of a set $\Gamma$ thereof if every model of $\Gamma$ is also a model of $\phi$. Put differently, there is no
valuation (or, possible world) where $\Gamma$ is true and $\phi$ is false. It follows directly that $\phi$ remains a logical consequence of $\Gamma
\cup \{\psi\}$, since $\Gamma$ is true in any world where $\Gamma \cup \{\psi\}$ is true.

It was pointed out by Shoham \cite{shohamSemanticApproach} that we may \say{bend the rules} and restrict semantic consideration to a privileged
subset of models deemed ``preferable''. We call these selected models the ``minimal'' models---a choice that will become clearer as this
chapter progresses.

% \section{Preferential Reasoning}
% \label{section:preferential-reasoning}
% In this work we are interested specifically in the KLM-style of non-monotonic reasoning, which will be introduced in the proceeding chapter. As a precursor, it is beneficial to discuss the semantic approach to non-monotonic reasoning put forward by Shoham \cite{shohamSemanticApproach}.

% \begin{definition}
% \label{definition:preferential-satisfaction-from-valuation}
% Given a formula $\phi \in \mathcal{L}$ and a valuation $u \in \mathcal{U}$, then $u$ \emph{preferentially satisfies} $\phi$ (and we write $u \vDash_\sqsubseteq \phi $) if and only if there is no other interpretation $v \in \mathcal{U}$ where $v \vDash \phi$ and $v \sqsubset u$. Then $u$ is a \emph{preferred}, or \emph{minimal} model of $\phi$.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}
% \label{definition:preferential-satisfiability}
% A formula $\phi \in \mathcal{L}$ is \emph{preferentially satisfiable} if it has a preferred model.
% \end{definition}

% From the two definitions above it may be obvious that every preferentially satisfiable formula is indeed classically satisfiable, while the converse is not true: To see why we need only consider an infinitely descending chain of valuations, and whether a tautology is preferentially satisfiable in such a structure.
\section{The KLM Framework}
The KLM framework for non-monotonic reasoning was initially described by a collection of consequence relations satisfying certain axioms---frequently
called the \textit{rationality postulates}---with each successive system being stronger than its predecessor. We borrow a nice story from Dov
Gabbay \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations} which motivates why consequence relations are a good starting point for the study of a non-monotonic
system.

Paraphrasing, he begins by asking the reader to imagine a machine that does non-monotonic inference in some domain. The machine represents knowledge
as formulae and so we pose queries of the form \say{Does $\psi$ non-monotonically follow from $\phi$?}. Something goes awry (suppose some
coffee was spilled), calling into question whether the logic of the machine still functions correctly. Even worse, the interface, which tells
us what real-world instance each formula maps to, is destroyed and so function cannot be evaluated based on the meaning of the formulae the
machine reasons on. How might we then evaluate the machine's function?

If we were interested in classical consequence, we would be well-equipped to assess the correctness of the machine by determining if it
satisfied reflexivity, monotonicity, and cut (we point to \Cref{definition:consequence-relations} as a reminder). This is precisely the starting
point that Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor took up in \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic}, suggesting that before getting to the semantics of a non-monotonic
system, it is a good idea to formalise axiomatise the system as a consequence relation satisfying certain properties.

The rationality postulates are precisely this axiomatisation, characterising a sensible pattern of reasoning for non-monotonic systems. We use
`$\twiddle$' (pronounced ``twiddle'') instead of `$\vdash$' to denote a non-monotonic consequence relation. As we may expect, $\phi \twiddle
\psi$ has the same meaning as $(\phi, \psi) \in \; \twiddle$, and $\phi \ntwiddle \psi$ as $(\phi, \psi)\not \in \; \twiddle$. We may, at
times of potential confusion, use a subscript to disambiguate which consequence relation is being referred to, and so $\twiddle_{C}$ would
refer to a cumulative relation, as defined below.

% An expression like $\phi \twiddle \psi$ is to be understood as saying \say{If $\phi$ holds, then $\psi$ is a typical consequence}, we call
% expressions of this nature \textit{conditional assertions}. The properties that a particular consequence relation satisfies are represented
% as rules of inference in the style of conditional assertions.

\subsection{Cumulative Reasoning}
\label{subsection:system-c}

\textit{Cumulative consequence relations}, otherwise referred to as \textit{System C}, represent the weakest of the systems in the KLM framework.
We follow the same exposition, from weaker to stronger systems, as \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic}: this approach will minimise repetition, as
each successive system inherits all properties of its predecessor.

\begin{definition}
  \label{definition:cumulative-consequence-relation} A consequence relation $\twiddle$ is a \emph{cumulative consequence relation} if and
  only if it satisfies the properties of \emph{Reflexivity, Left Logical Equivalence, Right Weakening, Cut} and \emph{Cumulative
  Monotonicity}.
\end{definition}

The first axiom, \textit{Reflexivity}, is largely self justifying: It makes little sense to speak about a notion of consequence that does not
satisfy this property.

\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:ref}\inferLeft{Reflexivity}{}{\phi \twiddle \phi}
\end{align}

The justification for \textit{Left Logical Equivalence} is a bit more opaque; the principle is that if two scenarios represent the same
state of affairs, and in one of these scenarios it we typically expect some consequence, then we should expect the same in the other
scenario.

\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:lle}\inferLeft{Left Logical Equivalence}{\vdash \phi \leftrightarrow \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma}{\psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Right Weakening} allows the preservation of classical consequence within the logic. It says that if it is always the case that from knowing
$\psi$ we conclude $\gamma$, and from knowing $\phi$ we normally conclude $\psi$, then we are entitled to hold the view that from $\phi$ we normally
expect $\gamma$ as well.

\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:rw}\inferLeft{Right Weakning}{\vdash \psi \rightarrow \gamma, \quad \phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Cautious Monotony} (which has also be called \textit{Cumulative Monotony} by Makinson \cite{makinson2003bridges}, and \textit{Restricted
Monotony} by Gabbay \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}) corresponds to the notion that if we are in an epistemic state $\phi$ where one
expectation, among others, is that $\psi$ holds. Learning that $\psi$ indeed holds should not alter the epistemic state in such a way that the
\textit{other} expectations are abandoned, and so the new state, $\phi \land \psi$, we should expect everything that was expected when all we
knew was $\phi$. In other words, we reason monotonically with respect to expected information.

\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:cm}\inferLeft{Cautious Monotony}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma }{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

Certain other rules may derived from the presence of already discussed postulates. A version of \textit{Cut}

\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:cut}\inferLeft{Cut}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

The original version due to Gentzen \cite{Ben1993Mathematical} is presented as:
\begin{align}
  \inferLeft{Monotonic Cut}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \alpha \twiddle \psi}{\phi \land \alpha \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
implies monotonicity, as it requires that if $\psi$ is a typical consequence of $\alpha$, then it must remain a consequence of $\alpha \land
\phi$: ergo, monotonicity. The former variation does not enforce this, and rather says \say{Suppose I have certain knowledge of $\phi$, and that if I were to assume $\psi$ I should expect to conclude $\gamma$. Then if I can show that infact $\psi$ was already an expected consequence of knowing $\phi$, I should expect that $\gamma$ follows from $\phi$}.
When considered alongside the argument for Cautious Monotony, Cut seems obviously acceptable.

The \textit{And} postulate suggests that if $\psi$ and $\gamma$ are both expected consequence of $\phi$, then their conjunction is also
expected. This postulate fails in probabilistic systems, such as \textit{association rules} \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}.
\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:and}\inferLeft{And}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \psi \land \gamma}
\end{align}

The following Lemma is a helpful intuition pump, it is largely why the term \textit{cumulative} is used for this system: it suggests that we
can use the consequences of plausible inferences to make further plausible inferences.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:cut-cautious} We can cover the properties of \emph{Cut} and \emph{Cumulative Monotonicity} with the following principle: \say{If $\phi \twiddle \psi$, then the typical consequences of $\phi$ and $\phi \land \psi$ coincide}.
\end{lemma}

Certain, frequently discussed properties in classical logic do not hold in cumulative consequence relations. Most obviously, cumulative consequence
relations do not satisfy
\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:monotonicity}\inferLeft{Monotonicity}{\psi \rightarrow \gamma, \quad \gamma \twiddle \phi}{\psi \twiddle \phi}
\end{align}
In addition, \textit{Transitivity} and \textit{Contraposition} which both imply monotonicity when considered alongside the other rules of
cumulative relations
\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:trans}\inferLeft{Transitivity}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
Transitivity, in \Cref{proof:transitivity}, was shown to be quite useful as a derived rule of a Hilbert system; but, for our purposes, it will
not do. Consider the example at the beginning of this chapter, where the topic of whether we should infer that Billy Pilgrim experiences chronological
time. Transitivity requires that we infer he does: Billy Pilgrim is a soldier, soldiers are human, and humans experience time chronologically.
But this is precisely the inference we do not want, and so transitivity must be abandoned.
%
\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:contra}\inferLeft{Contraposition}{\phi \twiddle \psi}{\neg \psi \twiddle \neg \phi}
\end{align}

These properties are undesirable as they imply monotonicity, precisely what we are interested in avoiding. However, it is worth reminding
ourselves of the discussion at the beginning of this chapter: That our aim is to develop a system which allows for more (credulous) inferences
to be made. A question that arises is whether non-monotonic systems should be \textit{supraclassical} \cite{makinson2003bridges}: should
classical inferences be preserved? Under the framing we have adopted, that classical deductions require iron-clad proofs beyond which is
often practical, and that these requirements could be relaxed in order to make more useful (but retractable) inferences. Then, if we have a classical
proof of something it should of course hold in a non-monotonic system.

\begin{align}
  \label{postulate:supraclassical}\inferLeft{Supraclassical}{\phi \rightarrow \psi}{\phi \twiddle \psi}
\end{align}

\textcolor{red}{Diagram ovals of worlds}

We will skip over any discussion of semantics for cumulative consequence relations, and rather opt to introduce these in the next section where
we discuss preferential consequence relations.

\subsection{Preferential Reasoning}
\label{subsection:system-P}

We, quite quickly, move on from cumulative to \textit{preferential consequence relations}, or \textit{system P}. The reason being that
system P is strictly stronger than system C, and includes in its' axiomatisation something analogous to the more significant part of the
deduction theorem, as well as disjunction. The semantics of system P, to be outlined in \Cref{subsubsection:preferential-interpretations},
are similar to the approach which was proposed by Shoham in \cite{shohamSemanticApproach}.

Fortunately, the definition of a preferential consequence relation is almost identical to that of cumulative one, with only the addition of
the \textit{Or} postulate.

\begin{definition}
  \label{definition:preferential-relation} The consequence relation $\twiddle$ is a \emph{preferential consequence relation} if and only if
  it satisfies the properties of \emph{Reflexivity, Left Logical Equivalence, Right Weakening, Cut, Or,} and \emph{Cumulative Monotonicity}.
\end{definition}

As a justification for \textit{Or}, consider that \textit{If Billy were abducted by aliens, normally he would be traumatised}, but also
\textit{If Billy witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, normally he would be traumatised}. If we know that at least one of these events
happened we should be allowed to conclude that Billy were traumatised, since either of them would normally allow this inference.

\begin{align}
  \inferLeft{Or}{\phi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \lor \psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

The addition of \textit{Or} to the rest of the properties of system C allow for useful derived rules. For instance, \textit{S}

\begin{align}
  \inferLeft{S}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \psi \rightarrow \gamma}
\end{align}

The derived rule \textit{S} is analogous to the deduction theorem (cf. \Cref{axiom:deduction-theorem}), and

\begin{lemma}[\cite{shohamSemanticApproach}]
  For $\phi, \psi \in \mathcal{L}$ and some valuation $u \in \mathcal{U}$, if $u \vdash \psi$ and $u \twiddle \phi$, then $u \twiddle \phi \land
  \psi$.
\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Preferential Interpretations}
\label{subsubsection:preferential-interpretations}

The semantics of system P provided by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic} are based on the \textit{preference logics} proposed
by Shoham \cite{shohamSemanticApproach}. The fundamental idea is that valuations, or \textit{worlds}, can be ordered by a \textit{preference
relation}, so that one world being preferred to another is a normative claim that we should consider deductions which hold in the preferred world
plausible.

It will be useful to recall some definitions from propositional logic: a valuation $u \in \mathcal{U}$ is a \textit{model} of a formula $\phi
\in \mathcal{L}$ if it satisfies $\phi$, $\phi$ is \textit{satisfiable} if it has a model. Another formula $\psi$ is a \textit{logical
consequence} of $\phi$ if the models of $\phi$ are a subset of the models of $\psi$.

We now introduce analogous definitions for these ideas in preference logic. The first change is that we regard satisfaction as a property
relative to a \textit{preferential interpretation}, the latter being defined as

\begin{definition}
  \label{definition:preferential-interpretation} A \emph{preferential interpretation} $\Pin$ is a triple where $S$ is a set of \emph{states},
  $l: S \to \mathcal{U}$ is a function mapping states to valuations, and $\prec$ is a strict partial-order on $S$.
\end{definition}

We can then define the notion of satisfaction, relative to a preferential interpretation, as:

\begin{definition}
  \label{definition:state-satisfaction} In a preferential interpretation $\pin$, we say that a state $s \in S$ \emph{satisfies} a formula $\phi
  \in \mathcal{L}$ if and only if the valuation $l(s) \vDash \phi$. In this case, we write $\pin, s \vDash \phi$, and use $\hat{\phi}$ to
  denote the set $\{s \in S \mid \pin,s \vDash \phi \}$.
\end{definition}

We are, of course, more interested in the kind of satisfaction not possible in classical propositional logic, the notion of \textit{preferential
satisfaction}. We first allow consideration to be restricted to the preferred worlds, and so we have

\begin{definition}
  \label{definition:state-minimal}

  Given a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ and some $\phi \in \mathcal{L}$, we write $\underline{\hat{\phi}}$ to denote the set $\{s \in \hat
  {\phi}\mid \nexists s' \in \hat{\phi}\text{ such that }s' \prec s \}$, which is the set of \textit{preferred states} which satisfy $\phi$ relative
  to $\pin$. We may also call this the set of \textit{minimal states} satisfying $\phi$.
\end{definition}

Then,

\begin{definition}
  \label{definition:preferentially-satisfiable} A formula $\phi \in \mathcal{L}$ is \emph{preferentially satisfiable} if and only if there
  exists a preferential interpretation $\pin$ such that for every state $s \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$ it holds that $\pin, s \vDash \phi$.
\end{definition}

It is obvious from this definition that a formula which is preferentially satisfiable will also be satisfiable in the classical sense; the converse
is not always true. To make this clear, we suggest another reading of what it means for a preferential interpretation to satisfy a formula.
A formula $\phi$ is satisfied by a preferential interpretation $W$ if there is some state $s \in S$ such that $l(s) \vDash \phi$ and there
is no $s' \in S$ where $s' \prec s$.

The culprit is the existence of infinitely descending chains in the preference relation on states. Consequently, it is often required that
the preference relation satisfy the following condition,

\begin{definition}
  \label{definition:smoothness} A preferential interpretation $\Pin$ satisfies the \textit{smoothness condition} if and only if each non-empty
  subset $T \subseteq S$ has a $\prec$-minimal state.
\end{definition}

A preferential interpretation that satisfies the smoothness condition is called \textit{well-founded}, or \textit{bounded}
\cite{shohamSemanticApproach,lehmann1992what}. Of course, every preferential interpretation with a finite set of states is well-founded. We then
remark that the, under the assumption of well-foundeness, a formula is (classically) satisfiable if and only if it is preferentially satisfiable.

As a matter of intuition, the enforcing the smoothness condition on a preference relation seems completely agreeable: It makes little sense,
when the express aim is to restrict consideration to a subset of the most preferred worlds, to order an infinite collection of worlds in terms
of how preferreable they are, and not have a starting point describing the \say{most preferable} worlds.

\begin{definition}
  \label{definition:preferential-satisfaction} A preferential interpretation $\pin$ \emph{satisfies} a defeasible conditional
  $\phi \twiddle \psi$ if and only if the $\prec$-\emph{minimal} states which satisfy $\phi$ also satisfy $\psi$, equivalently if
  $W \vDash_{P}\phi \twiddle \psi$ if $\underline{\hat{\phi}}\subseteq \hat{\psi}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  \label{example:preferential-interpretation}

  Consider the knowledge base
  \[
    \Delta = \big\{h \twiddle c, \; s \twiddle h, \; b \rightarrow \neg c \; \big\}
  \]

  containing both defeasible conditionals, as well as classical propositional formulae. The knowledge base encodes the setting where \say{Humans normally experience time chronologically},
  \say{Soldiers are normally human}, and \say{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time.}

  There are many preferential interpretations which may satisfy $\Delta$, one of these is depicted below: Each set contains the states which
  map to a valuation that satisfies the respective propositional atom. The shaded area of a set represents the minimal states for that set, and
  so the green shading represents the set $\hat{s}$.

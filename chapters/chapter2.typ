= Formal Concept Analysis <chapter:fca> 

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) provides a simple, and yet mathematically rigorous, framework for identifying and reasoning about "concepts" and their corresponding hierarchies in data. The central view of concepts as a dual between extension---what one refers to as instances of a concept---and intension---what meaning is ascribed to a concept---is supported by a rich philosophical backing.

                 Analysis”, a new area of research which is based on a
                 set-theoretical model for concepts and conceptual hierarchies.
                 This model yields not only a new approach to data analysis but
                 also methods for formal representation of conceptual knowledge.
                 These methods are outlined on three levels. First, basics on
                 concept lattices are explained starting from simple data
                 contexts which consist of a binary relation between objects and
                 attributes indicating which object has which attribute. On the
                 second level, conceptual relationships are discussed for data
                 matrices which assign attribute values to each of the given
                 objects. Finally, a mathematical model for conceptual knowledge
                 systems is described. This model allows us to study
                 mathematically the representation, inference, acquisition, and
                 communication of conceptual knowledge.},

     abstract = {In general, lattice theory has helped to simplify, unify and
                 generalize many aspects of mathematics, and it has suggested
                 many interesting new problems. In an era of ever-increasing
                 proliferation of scientific results, its relative simplicity and
                 unifying influence are certainly healthy and refreshing.
                 (Birkhoff [4, p. 1]) Diagrams prove nothing, but bring
                 outstanding features readily to the eye; they are therefore no
                 substitute for such critical tests as may be applied to the data
                 , but are valuable in suggesting such tests, and explaining the
                 conclusions founded upon them. (Fisher [16, p. 24]) Quel que
                 soit le point de départ de l'activité scientifique, cette
                 activité ne peut pleinement convaincre qu'en quittant le domaine
                 de base: si elle expéimente, il faut raisonner; si elle raisonne
                 , il faut expérimenter. (Bachelard [41. p. 3])11The original

                 led to a remarkable observation: Any consistent system of
                 default rules imposes an unambiguous and natural ordering on
                 these rules which, to emphasize its simple and basic character,
                 we term "Z-ordering." This ordering can be used with various
                 levels of refinement, to prioritize conflicting arguments, to
                 rank the degree of abnormality of states of the world, and to
                 define plausible consequence relationships. This paper defines
                 the Z-ordering, briefly mentions its semantical origins, and
                 illustrates two simple entailment relationships induced by the
                 ordering. Two extensions are then described, maximum-entropy and
                 conditional entailment, which trade in computational simplicity
                 for semantic refinements.},

\chapter{Defeasible Reasoning}
\label{chapter:defeasible-reasoning}

The study of logical systems which violate monotonicity has received significant attention. Largely, the motivation for violating monotonicity is
that it can be beneficial to make more credulous inferences. Frequently, we are required to make decisions without perfect knowledge of the
environment. If, in light of new information, we are able to change our minds, then the decision making process displays non-monotonic behaviour.

This work is interested in one particular style of non-monotonic reasoning developed by Kraus, Lehamnn, and Magidor
\shortcite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what}, frequently referred to by its initialisation as the \textit{KLM framework}.

\section{Background on Non-monotonic Reasoning}
\label{section:nmr-background}

Near the end of the previous chapter, the matter of consequence was discussed in a very formal sense. It is perhaps helpful to distinguish the formal
treatment of consequence from its colloquial use, as the former yields some surprising results which do not appear at all congruent with how a
person, or otherwise intelligent agent should reason \cite{tarski1936consequence,kraus1990nonmonotonic}. As a demonstration of a result, which may be
surprising in this way, consider the following propositions which state that \textit{humans experience chronological time, soldiers are human}, and
that \textit{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\texttt{human}\rightarrow \texttt{chronological time}$
	\item $\texttt{soldier}\rightarrow \texttt{human}$
	\item $\texttt{Billy Pilgrim}\rightarrow \neg \texttt{chronological time}$
\end{enumerate}

Knowing these propositions, if one were to encounter an individual who were a soldier then it would seem appropriate, by propositions 1 and 2, to
deduce that the individual's experience of time was chronological. Suppose that after some conversation, it was learned that the individual's name
was Billy Pilgrim (this could be represented more formally by adding the statement $\texttt{Billy Pilgrim} \rightarrow \texttt{soldier}$ to our
knowledge base). In light of this, one should retract the previous inference and instead deduce that the individual's experience of time were in fact
non-chronological.

If one were using some classical system, such as propositional logic, such recourse would not be possible. On first encounter with the individual,
the set of valuations which are consistent with the prior knowledge, alongside the recognition that the individual were a soldier, is reduced to the
single model: $\,\{\overline{b}, c, h, s\}\,$ ($b,c,h,s$ represent \textit{Billy Pilgrim, chronological time, human,} and \textit{soldier},
respectively). When it is later learned that the individual is Billy Pilgrim, the previous valuation is no longer consistent with what we know. In
fact, there is no model of our knowledge, and our theory becomes unsatisfiable. By the principle of explosion, our theory now entails everything,
including that the individual experiences time both chronologically and non-chronologically. Indeed, in telling us that everything follows, such
theories tell us nothing.

This property---that adding new information can never result in retraction of prior knowledge---is called monotonicity. The presence of monotonicity
prevents one from making inferences that we are not absolutely certain of. Intuitively, this means we may not infer anything that does not hold in
all the possible worlds, relative to what we already know. In other words, only infer that which is true in every model of our current knowledge. If
we remain in the classical realm, it seems our only options are to abandon our original claim or risk explosion.

At this point it is a good idea to provide some early intuitions on how one might violate monotonicity in a reasonable way. Continuing with the
example, it is reasonable to suggest that typically we think think that humans expereince time chronologically. In order to reconcile the information
that Billy Pilgrim is a human who experiences non-chronological time, it could be that he is simply an a-typical human.

In the proceeding section, these ideas will be explored in a more formal manner. The idea observed by Shoham \shortcite{shohamSemanticApproach}, that
we may ``bend the rules'' of logical consequence and restrict consideration to privileged subsets of valuations deemed `preferable' is foundational
to this kind of reasoning.

\section{Preferential Reasoning and the KLM Framework}
\label{section:klm-framework}

The KLM framework for non-monotonic reasoning was initially described by a collection of consequence relations satisfying certain axioms, frequently
called the \textit{rationality postulates}. These axioms describe a reasonable account of non-monotonic consequence. We borrow a nice story from Dov
Gabbay \shortcite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}, in which he motivates why consequence relations are a good starting point for the study of
non-monotonic systems.

Paraphrasing, the reader to imagine a machine that is supposed to do some kind of non-monotonic inference. The machine maps meaningful expressions of
knowledge onto formulae, and so queries of the form \say{Does $\phi$ follow (non-monotonically) from $\psi$?}. Something goes awry (suppose some
coffee was spilled), calling into question whether the logic of the machine still functions correctly. Even worse, the interface, which provides the
mapping between formulae and which concrete pieces of knowledge they represent, is destroyed. Consequently, if the machine functions correctly cannot
be determined based on its output since the meaning represented by each formula cannot be ascertained. How might one then evaluate the machine's
function? If we were interested in classical consequence, we would be well-equipped to assess the correctness of the machine by determining if it
satisfied reflexivity, monotonicity, and cut (we point to \Cref{definition:consequence-relations} as a reminder). In other words, to study the more
abstract properties of consequence.

This is precisely the starting point that Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor took up in \shortcite{kraus1990nonmonotonic}, suggesting that before getting to
the semantics of a non-monotonic system, it is a good idea to axiomatise the system as a consequence relation satisfying certain properties. The
rationality postulates are precisely this axiomatisation, characterising a sensible pattern of reasoning for non-monotonic systems. The symbol
`$\twiddle$' (pronounced ``twiddle'') is used instead of `$\vdash$' to denote a non-monotonic consequence relation. As may be expected, $\phi
	\twiddle \psi$ has the same meaning as $(\phi, \psi) \in \; \twiddle$, and $\phi \ntwiddle \psi$ as $(\phi , \psi)\not \in \; \twiddle$. At times of
potential confusion, a subscript may be used to disambiguate which consequence relation is being referred to, and so $\twiddle_{p}$ would refer to a
preferential relation, as defined below.

\subsection{Preferential Consequence Relations}
\label{subsection:system-P} \index{non-monotonic reasoning! system P}

We begin the exposition of the KLM framework by looking at \textit{preferential consequence}, or \textit{system P}.
\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferential-relation}

	The consequence relation $\twiddle$ is a \emph{preferential consequence relation} if and only if it satisfies the properties of \emph{Reflexivity},
	\emph{Left Logical Equivalence}, \emph{Right Weakening}, \emph{And}, \emph{Or}, and \emph{Cautious Monotony}.
\end{definition}
Each property, or postulate, of preferential relations is presented in a style analogous to inference rules. The intended meaning is that, if all
statements above the line are included in the relation, then the statement below must also be included.
\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:ref}
	\inferLeft{Reflexivity}{}{\phi \twiddle \phi}
\end{align}
The first axiom, \textit{Reflexivity}, is largely self justifying. It makes little sense to speak about a notion of consequence that does not satisfy
this property. Such systems are discussed in \Cref{subsection:association-rules}, although we are reluctant to call them ``logical''.
\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:lle}
	\inferLeft{Left Logical Equivalence}{\vdash \phi \leftrightarrow \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma}{\psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
The justification for \textit{Left Logical Equivalence} is a bit more opaque. The principle it describes is that if two scenarios represent the same
state of affairs, and in one of these scenarios it we typically expect some consequence, then we should expect the same in the other scenario.
\textcolor{red}{Invariant to substitution of logically equivalent formulas?}
\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:rw}
	\inferLeft{Right Weakning}{\vdash \psi \rightarrow \gamma, \quad \phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
\textit{Right Weakening} allows the preservation of classical consequence within preferential logic. It says that, if from $\phi$ we normally expect
$\psi$, but from $\psi$ we \textit{always} see $\gamma$, then we are entitled to think that from $\phi$ we normally expect $\gamma$ as well.
\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:or}
	\inferLeft{Or}{\phi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \lor \psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
As a justification for \textit{Or}, consider that \textit{Normally, if Billy were abducted by aliens he would be traumatised}, but also
\textit{Normally, if Billy witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden he would be traumatised}. If we learned that either of these events took place, we
should find it plausible to infer that Billy were traumatised.
\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:and}
	\inferLeft{And}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \psi \land \gamma}
\end{align}
The \textit{And} postulate suggests that if $\psi$ and $\gamma$ are both expected consequence of $\phi$ , then their conjunction is also expected.
This postulate fails in probabilistic systems, such as \textit{association rules} \cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}.
\begin{align}
	\label[postulate]{postulate:cm}
	\inferLeft{Cautious Monotony}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \twiddle \gamma }{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
\textit{Cautious Monotony} (which has also be called \textit{Cumulative Monotony} by \cite{makinson2003bridges}, and \textit{Restricted Monotony} by
\cite{gabbay1985theoreticalFoundations}) corresponds to the notion that if we are in an epistemic state $\phi$ where one expectation, among others,
is that $\psi$ holds. Learning that $\psi$ indeed holds should not alter the epistemic state in such a way that the \textit{other} expectations are
abandoned, and so the new state, $\phi \land \psi$ , we should expect everything that was expected when all we knew was $\phi$ . In other words, we
reason monotonically with respect to expected information. The above postulates capture the essence of preferential (consequence) relations. Much
like we saw with Hilbert systems, however, certain rules, which reveal interesting properties of system P, may be derived. A version of \textit{Cut}:
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:cut}
	\inferLeft{Cut}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
\end{align}
The original version due to Gentzen \cite{Ben1993Mathematical}, which is presented as:
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Monotonic Cut}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma, \quad \alpha \twiddle \psi}{\phi \land \alpha \twiddle \gamma}.
\end{align}
This construction implies monotonicity as it requires that the typical consequence of $\alpha$, which is $\psi$, must remain a consequence when the
conjunction $\alpha \land \phi$ is considered. The former variation does not enforce this, and rather says \say{Suppose I have certain knowledge of
	$\phi$ , and that if I were to assume $\psi$ I should expect to conclude $\gamma$ . Then if I can show that infact $\psi$ was already an expected
	consequence of knowing $\phi$ , I should expect that $\gamma$ follows from $\phi$ }. When considered alongside the argument for Cautious Monotony,
Cut seems acceptable.

The rule $S$ , which is analogous to one half of the deduction theorem (cf. \Cref{axiom:deduction-theorem}), expresses the notion that we retain
plausible inferences when conditioned on a hypothesis.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{S}{\phi \land \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \psi \rightarrow \gamma}
\end{align}

In light of the properties preferential consequence relations do satisfy, it is also useful to consider those properties they do not.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Monotonicity}{\phi \twiddle \psi}{\phi \land \gamma \twiddle \psi}                                                      \\
	\inferLeft{Transitivity}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \gamma} \label{inference-rule:transitivity} \\
	\inferLeft{Contraposition}{\phi \twiddle \psi}{\neg \psi \twiddle \neg \phi}
\end{align}
Quite obviously, monotonicity is not a property of non-monotonic consequence relations. It turns out that transitivity implies monotonicity, and so
is not satisfied either. Inforamlly, transitivity allows consequences to propagate through chains of inheritance. This is precisely in opposition to
the scenario described earlier where Billy Pilgrim was a human, humans experienced time chronologically, and yet Billy Pilgrim did not. For a more
technical treatment we reference the syntax of \Cref{inference-rule:transitivity} directly, in order for transitivity to hold it is required that the
second premise of the rule, $\psi \twiddle \gamma$, continues to hold as $\psi \land \phi \twiddle \gamma$; note that this is a much stronger claim
that cautious monotony. For contraposition, the argument is similar.

The following lemma which, admittedly makes more sense after a discussion of semantics, provides useful intuition for how certain chains of
(non-monotonic) reasoning may occur. It suggests that we can use the consequences of plausible inferences to make further plausible inferences.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:cut-cautious}

	We can cover the properties of \emph{cut} and \emph{cautious monotonicity} with the following principle: \say{If $\phi \twiddle \psi$ , then the
		typical consequences of $\phi$ and $\phi \land \psi$ coincide}.
\end{lemma}

% \begin{align} \label{postulate:monotonicity}\inferLeft{Monotonicity}{\psi \rightarrow \gamma, \quad \gamma \twiddle \phi}{\psi
% \twiddle \phi} \end{align} % In addition, \textit{Transitivity} and \textit{Contraposition} both imply monotonicity when
% considered alongside the other rules of cumulative relations % \begin{align}
% \label{postulate:trans}\inferLeft{Transitivity}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \psi \twiddle \gamma}{\phi \twiddle \gamma}
% \end{align}

% \begin{align} \label{postulate:contra}\inferLeft{Contraposition}{\phi \twiddle \psi}{\neg \psi \twiddle \neg \phi} \end{align}

% These properties are undesirable as they imply monotonicity.
It is, however, worth reminding ourselves of the goal that was set out at the start of this chapter: To formalise a system which facilitates a more
credulous style of reasoning. That is, we are interested in making \textit{more} inferences than can be made under classical notions of consequence.
One property which has not been discussed is whether the proposed system be \textit{supraclassical} \cite{makinson2003bridges}.
\begin{align}
	\label{postulate:supraclassical}
	\inferLeft{Supraclassical}{\phi \rightarrow \psi}{\phi \twiddle \psi}
\end{align}
Supraclassicality is the question of whether classical inferences be preserved in a non-classical system. Defeasible inferences are useful in that
they can be made despite the existence of exceptions. When there are no exceptions, we should be able to maintain the validity of classical
reasoning.
\subsection{Preferential Interpretations}
\label{subsubsection:preferential-interpretations}

The semantics for preferential relations, provided by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor \shortcite{kraus1990nonmonotonic}, are based on the
\textit{preference logics} introduced by Shoham \shortcite{shohamSemanticApproach}. The fundamental idea is that valuations, or \textit{worlds}, can
be ordered by a \textit{preference relation} so that one world being preferred to another is the normative claim that we should consider deductions
which hold in the preferred world as more plausible than those made from the other.

It will be useful to recall some definitions from propositional logic: a valuation $u \in \mathcal{U}$ is a \textit{model} of a formula $\phi \in
	\mathcal{L}$ if it satisfies $\phi$ , $\phi$ is \textit{satisfiable} if it has a model. Another formula $\psi$ is a \textit{logical consequence} of
$\phi$ if the models of $\phi$ are a subset of the models of $\psi$ . We now introduce analogous definitions in the setting of preferential logic.
The first change is that we consider a richer language, $\Lang$ . This is $\lang$ extended with the new connective `$\twiddle$' such that $\phi
	\twiddle \psi$ is a sentence in $\Lang$ when $\phi, \psi \in \mathcal{L}$ . One should not overlook that the usage of the `$\twiddle$' has now
shifted from an element of the metalanguage, where it refers to a kind of consequence relation, to an object level connective, used somewhat
analogously to the classical Boolean operator `$\rightarrow$'. Certain restrictions on the usage of `$\twiddle$' do apply. In particular, the nesting
of defeasible statements is not permitted, and so $\phi \twiddle (\psi \twiddle \gamma )$ is not a statement in the language $\Lang$ . At times, we
may wish to distinguish between formulae in $\Lang$ which do not use `$\twiddle$', and so we refer to these as classical, and the alternative as
defeasible formulae. Defeasible conditionals may be satisfied by a \textit{preferential interpretation}, which is a structure defined as:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferential-interpretation}
	\index{non-monotonic reasoning! system P! preferential interpretation}

	A \emph{preferential interpretation} $\Pin$ is a triple where $S$ is a set of \emph{states}, $l: S \to \mathcal{U}$ is a function mapping states to
	valuations, and $\prec$ is a strict partial-order on $S$ .
\end{definition}

The preference relation provides a basis for restricting ourselves to consider only those preferred worlds, which represent a normal state of
affairs. This idea is formalised as \textit{minimal states}:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:state-minimal}

	Given a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ and some $\phi \in \Lang$ , we write $\underline{\hat{\phi}}$ to denote the set $\{\,s \in \hat{\phi}\mid
		\nexists s' \in \hat{\phi}\text{ such that }s' \prec s \,\}$ , which is the set of \textit{preferred states} that satisfy $\phi$ . We may also call
	these the \textit{$\phi$ -minimal} states.
\end{definition}

It is necessary to stress the distinction between states in a preferential interpretation and valuations. There is no requirement that the mapping
from states to valuations be injective, and so the same valuation may appear many times in the preference relation under distinct states. A corollary
is that, given a finite set of valuations, the set of states may be infinite. In turn, the preference relation of a preferential interpretation is
required to satisfy the \textit{smoothness} condition (which has also been called \textit{boundedness} in \cite{shohamSemanticApproach}, or
\textit{stoppering} \cite{makinson2003bridges}):

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:smoothness}
	\index{binary relation! smoothness}

	A preferential interpretation $\Pin$ is called \textit{smooth} if and only if for each $\phi \in \Lang$ , and each state $s \in \hat{\phi}$
	satisfying $\phi$ , either $s \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$ or there exists another state $s' \in \hat{\phi}$ where $s' \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$ .
\end{definition}

The smoothness condition is violated by preference relations which fail to satisfy transitivity, or where there are infinite descending chains of
more preferred states \cite{Schlechta1996}. The consequence relations of preferential interpretations with non-smooth preference relations may fail
to satisfy cautious monotony \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,makinson2003bridges}.
% TODO add a demonstration of why

Although it causes no confusion, there are distinct formulations of what it means for a preferential interpretation to satisfy a classical versus a
defeasible formula. For the classical case, we have the following:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:state-satisfaction}

	Given a preferential interpretation $\pin$ , we say that a state $s \in S$ \emph{satisfies} a classical formula $\phi \in \Lang$ if and only if the
	valuation $l(s) \vDash \phi$ . In this case, we write $\pin, s \vDash \phi$ , and use $\hat{\phi}$ to denote the set $\{\,s \in S \mid \pin,s \vDash
		\phi \,\}$ . Then, $\pin$ \textit{satisfies} $\phi$ if and only if $\pin , s \vDash \phi$ for all $s \in S$ .
\end{definition}

What it means for a preferential interpretation to satisfy a classical formula is unsurprising, and corresponds to the idea that the formula holds in
every possible world. We are more interested in what it means for defeasible formulae to be satisfied, and so we have:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:preferentially-satisfiable}

	A defeasible formula $\phi \twiddle \psi \in \Lang$ is \emph{satisfied} by a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ if and only if the every minimal
	state $s \in \underline{\hat{\phi}}$ also satisfies $\psi$ . In this case we write $\pin \VDash \phi \twiddle \psi$ and say that $\pin$ is a
	\emph{preferential model} of $\phi \twiddle \psi$ .
\end{definition}

One pleasing perspective on the semantics of preferential consequence relations is that we require little in the way of ``new machinery''. Outside of
the preference relation, satisfaction of a defeasible conditional behaves similarly to satisfaction of classical formulae, only with a restriction on
which states should be considered.

\begin{example}
	\label{example:preferential-interpretation}

	Consider the knowledge base \[ \Delta = \{\,\, h \twiddle c,\; s \twiddle h, \; b \rightarrow \neg c \, \,\} \]
	which contains both defeasible conditionals, as well as classical propositional formulae. The knowledge base encodes the setting
	where \say{Normally, humans experience time chronologically}, \say{Normally, soldiers are human}, and \say{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time.} \Cref{figure:preferential-interpretation} represents a preferential model of $\Delta$. The line diagrams
	contained in the figure represent all the necessary information required to determine which are the minimal
	states satisfying each proposition.

	\end{figure}

	As a means of providing some intuition for \Cref{lemma:cut-cautious}, which says that ``If $\phi \twiddle \psi$ then the plausible consequences of
	$\phi$ and $\phi \land \psi$ coincide'', we note that the interpretation is a model of $h \twiddle c$ , and that collection of minimal states
	satisfying $h$ is precisely the same set as those satisfying $h \land c$ .
\end{example}

The next two theorems constitute a representation result which shows that the correspondence between preferential consequence relations and
preferential interpretations is sound and complete. That is, every preferential consequence relation is defined by some preferential interpretation,
and that every preferential interpretation defines some preferential consequence relation.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem:soundness-preferential}

	If $\Pin$ is a preferential interpretation and $\phi, \psi \in \Lang$ , then $\pin$ defines the consequence relation $\twiddle_{\pin}$ given by the
	set $\{\,\phi \twiddle_{\pin}\psi \mid \pin \VDash \phi \twiddle \psi\,\}$ , which satisfies \textit{Reflexivity}, \textit{Left Logical Equivalence},
	\textit{Right Weakening}, \textit{Or}, and \textit{Cautious Monotony} and is thus a preferential consequence relation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem:completeness-preferential}

	If $\twiddle_{P}$ is a preferential consequence relation, then there exists a preferential interpretation $W$ which induces the consequence relation
	$\twiddle_{W}$ such that $\twiddle_{P}$ is precisely $\twiddle_{W}$ .
\end{theorem}

The requirement that preferential interpretations define an ordering on states, which then map to valuations, rather than on valuations directly
seems quite arbitrary. Certainly, Shoham \shortcite{shohamSemanticApproach} makes no such distinction in their preferential logic. However, Kraus,
Lehmann, and Magidor \shortcite{kraus1990nonmonotonic} provide an example, aptly described as ``en passant'' by \cite{Bezzazi1997}, which shows that
it is necessary. The example considers a preferential consequence relation generated by a preferential interpretation where the function mapping
states to valuations is not injective. It is then shown that there is no other preferential interpretation with an injective mapping with an
equivalent consequence relation.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:states-preferential}

	There exists a non-injective preferential interpretation $\pin$ which defines the consequence relation $\twiddle_{\pin}$ such that no injective
	preferential interpretation defines the same consequence relation.
\end{lemma}

\Cref{figure:duplicate-states-example} shows a portion of the preferential interpretation in \Cref{example:preferential-interpretation}. The states
$s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are duplicate states, specifically they both map to the valuation $\{\,s,h,\overline{c}\,\}$ . As before, this preferential
interpretation is a model of $s \twiddle h$ as the set of minimal $s$ -states, $\{\,s_{2},s_{3} \,\}$ , is a subset of the $h$-states.

% Consider the more finely grained portion of the preferential interpretation in \Cref{figure:preferential-interpretation}. As
% before, the interpretation is a model of the conditional $s \twiddle h$. It is not, however, a model of $s \twiddle c$ given
% that $s_{2}$, a duplicate state to $s_{1}$, is a minimal state satisfying $s$ which does not satisfy $c$.

which is a minimal $s$ -state that does not satisfy $c$ . Should the duplicate states be merged into $s_{12}$ , so that now $s_{3}\prec s_{12}$ and
$s_{4}\prec s_{12}$ , then $s \twiddle c$ would be satisfied, since $s_{12}$ is no longer an $s$-minimal state.

\subsection{Preferential Entailment}
\label{subsection:preferential-entailment}

Equipped with definitions for the class of preferential relations and a representation theorem that relates these to a corresponding semantics
derived from preferential interpretations, it is appropriate to discuss the matter of \textit{preferential entailment}.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:p-entailment}

	A defeasible knowledge base $\Delta$ \textit{preferentially entails} a defeasible conditional $\phi \in \Lang$ if and only if $\phi$ is satisfied by
	every preferential model of $\Delta$ . In this case we write $\Delta \pentails \phi$ . The set of all defeasible conditionals that can be
	preferentially entailed from $\Delta$ is denoted by $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$ and is called the \textit{preferential closure} of $\Delta$ .
\end{definition}

When we speak of the \textit{closure} of a set of preferential statements $\Delta$ , described by the closure operator $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$ , it is
reasonable to question whether what is really meant is a closure operator in the sense of \Cref{definition:closure-operator}. Afterall, one property
of closure operators is that they are monotone, and so if we really do have a closure operator then $\Delta \subseteq \Delta'$ implies that
$\Cn{p}(\Delta) \subseteq \Cn{p}(\Delta')$ . In other words, preferential entailment describes a monotone relation. We begin by describing the
closure system corresponding to $\Cn{p}$ .

\begin{proposition}
	\label{proposition:entailemnt-relations-intersection}

	Let $\Delta$ be a defeasible knowledge base over $\Lang$, $\phi \twiddle \psi$ a defeasible statement in the same language, and $\mathfrak{W}$ be the
	set of all preferential relations induced by models of $\Delta$. Then, $\phi \twiddle \psi \in \Cn{p}(\Delta)$ if and only if $\phi \twiddle \psi \in
		\bigcap \mathfrak{W}$.
\end{proposition}

We abuse notation here, and use $\twiddle$ to mean the object-level connective, as well as to denote a preferential consequence relation. It does not
cause any issue, as the connective $\phi \twiddle \psi$ is satisfied by a preferential model $\pin$ if and only if it is in the preferential relation
$\twiddle_\pin$ induced by $\pin$ . The proposition states that the preferential consequence operator applied to $\Delta$ amounts to the intersection
of of the preferential consequence relations induced by the models of $\Delta$ . The next proposition confirms what might already be suspected: that
preferential consequence relations are closed under arbitrary intersections.

\begin{proposition}
	\label{proposition:intersection-preferential-relations}

	If $\mathfrak{W}$ is a set of preferential relations, then the intersection $\bigcap \mathfrak{W}$ is itself a preferential relation.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	\label{proof:intersection-preferential-relations}

	Let $\mathfrak{W}$ be a set of preferential relations and suppose the intersection, $\pin$ , were not preferential. Then $\pin$ is not closed under
	application of \Crefrange{postulate:ref}{postulate:cm}. This means that there is some $\pin' \in \mathfrak{W}$ that is also not closed in the same
	way. Then $\pin'$ is not a preferential relation either, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

Indeed, the preferential consequence operator is a closure operator in the strict sense, and preferential entailment is monotonic. The entailment
relation can further be characterised by a single smallest preferential consequence relation which, by \Cref{theorem:completeness-preferential},
\lucas{has a canonical model}.

\begin{theorem}
	\label{theorem:preferential-entailment-monotonic}

	Let $\Delta$ be a set of defeasible statements in $\Lang$, and $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$ its preferential closure. Then $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$ grows monotonically
	with $\Delta$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	\label{proof:preferential-entailment-monotonic}

	Suppose that $\phi \twiddle \psi \in \Cn{p}(\Delta)$ and $\phi \twiddle \psi \not \in \Cn{p}(\Delta')$ with $\Delta \subseteq \Delta'$ . For every
	model $\pin$ of $\Delta$ we have $\phi \twiddle_\pin \psi$ (this follows from \Cref{proposition:entailemnt-relations-intersection}), but also there
	exists a model $\mathcal{V}$ of $\Delta'$ such that $\phi \ntwiddle_\mathcal{V} \psi$ . Since $\Delta \subseteq \Delta'$ we have that any model of
	$\Delta'$ is also a model of $\Delta$ , then $\mathcal{V}$ is a model of $\Delta$ and so $\phi \twiddle \psi \not \in \Cn{p}(\Delta)$ , which is a
	contradiction.
\end{proof}

There is room for some (justified) confusion here. After all, we have carefully avoided satisfying otherwise useful properties because they imply
monotonicity, only to end up with precisely that. To clarify this, we recognise that a system can display non-monotonic behaviour in different areas.
Indeed the entailment relation of system P---which reasons on the metalevel---is monotonic, while the object level expresses non-monotonic behaviour,
facilitating the expression of statements like \textit{Normally Humans experience chronological time}, \textit{Billy Pilgrim is a Human},
\textit{Billy Pilgrim experiences non-chronological time}. There are arguments, in fact we make one in \Cref{section:preferential-contexts}, which
suggest that object level non-monotonicity is sufficient.

We now collect some further results which---apart from being interesting in their own right---will be useful in the second part of this work.

\begin{corollary}
	\label{corollary:preferential-entailment-postulates}

	$\Delta \pentails \phi \twiddle \psi$ if and only if there is a proof from $\Delta$ to $\phi \twiddle \psi$ derived by
	application of \Crefrange{postulate:ref}{postulate:cm}.
\end{corollary}

One may have presumed that, due to the resemblance of the postulates to Hilbert-style inference rules,
\Cref{corollary:preferential-entailment-postulates} would hold in quite a trivial sense. While this presumption would be technically correct, one
should be cautious here. In a moment a system very close to preferential reasoning will be presented, characterised by an almost identical set of
postulates, for which the corresponding version of this corollary fails. To grasp why it holds for preferential entailment, consider the following
proof.

\begin{proof}
	\label{proof:preferential-entailment-postulates}

	We begin with the \textit{if} direction. For contraposition, assume that there is no proof from $\Delta$ to $\phi \twiddle \psi$ using the
	postulates. That is, if $\Delta$ were closed under application of the postulates, call this $\Delta^P$, then $\phi \twiddle \psi \not \in \Delta^P$.
	Need to finish this wording, basically show that all models of $\Delta$ have consequence relations that are preferential, and so $\Delta^P \subseteq
		\pin$ for any model.

\end{proof}

% \clearpage The definition provided for preferential entailment is worryingly similar to the Tarskian idea of logical
% consequence, described in \Cref{subsection:logical-consequence}. % The structure of preferential entailment should be quite
% familiar. It is a Tarskian notion of consequence where, just as in the % classical case, entailment from a set is determined by
% checking all models of the set. The difference is that, in this case, % models are preferential interpretations, rather than
% classical valuations. The preferential closure of $\Delta$ is the set of % all expressions that every model of $\Delta$
% ``agrees'' should hold. By \Cref{theorem:soundness-preferential}, each preferential % model $\pin$ induces a corresponding
% preferential consequence relation. From the perspective of preferential relations, % entailment can be regarded as taking the
% intersection of the preference relations induced by the models of $\Delta$. We % formalise this below. \begin{proof}
% \label{proof:closure-system-preferential-consequence} Let $\mathfrak{W}$ be a set of % preferential relations, and $\pin$ be
% $\bigcap \mathfrak{W}$. Suppose $\pin$ were not preferential, then it must not be closed % under the postulates. Since it is the
% intersection of preferential relations, one of these relations must not have been closed % in the same way. (this is a bad proof
% write up, just for intuition right now). \end{proof} By % \Cref{proposition:closure-system-preferential-consequence}, if
% $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$ is treated as a consequence relation, then it is % a preferential relation. \begin{proof} Presume To show the
% \textit{only if} direction, suppose that a proof of $\phi \twiddle % \psi$ from $\Delta$ by
% \Crefrange{postulate:ref}{postulate:cm} does not exist. That is, the smallest closed preferential % relation $\twiddle_\pin$
% containing $\Delta$ does not contain $\phi \twiddle \psi$. By completeness % (\Cref{theorem:completeness-preferential}) there is
% a preferential interpretation $\pin$ that defines $\twiddle_\pin$. $\pin$ is % a model of $\Delta$, and so $\Delta \npentails
% \phi \twiddle \psi$. \end{proof} What is quite clear, however, is that % Nonetheless, $\phi \twiddle \psi$ is preferentially
% entailed by $\Delta$ if all the preferential models ``agree'' that $\phi % \twiddle \psi$ holds. Each preferential model $\pin$
% induces a corresponding preferential consequence relation % $\twiddle_{\pin}$; and so, preferential entailment may be
% considered, from the perspective of consequence relations, to be the % intersection of all preferential relations which
% correspond to models of $\Delta$. It is only ``worrying'' insofar as Tarskian consequence is monotonic, and we are interested in
% non-monotonic entailment relations. Indeed, this concern is justified: If we consider the set of preferential models of a
% defeasible knowledge base $\Delta$ , then the set of conditionals they all agree on is exactly the preferential closure,
% $\Cn{p}(\Delta)$ . The addition of another conditional to our knowledge base, resulting in $\Delta \cup \{\,\, \delta \,\,\}$ ,
% only serves to reduce consideration to those preferential models of $\Delta$ that also satisfy $\phi$ . Within this restricted
% set of models, the consensus on $\Cn{p}(\Delta )$ remains. Formally, we have: \begin{align} \Delta \subseteq \Delta \cup
% \{\,\delta\,\} \quad \textit{implies}\quad \Cn{p}(\Delta) \subseteq \Cn{p}(\Delta \cup \{\, \delta \,\}). \end{align}

\subsection{Rational Consequence Relations}
\label{subsection:rational-consequence-relations}

System P provides a characterisation, in the form of its postulates, of a particular style of non-monotonic reasoning. There are other kinds of
reasoning, not valid in system P, for which there are good reasons think of as reasonable properties of non-monotonic reasoning
\cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what}.

\textit{Negation Rationality} suggests that our defeasible inferences should withstand piercing the veil of ignorance. Suppose Alice is a university
student, if she holds the belief that \textit{Normally, she will pass her exams}, then it would not be reasonable for her to simultaneously think
\textit{Normally, if she studies, she will not pass her exams} and also \textit{Normally, if she does not study, she will not pass her exams}.

\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Negation Rationality}{\phi \land \psi \ntwiddle \gamma, \quad \phi \land \neg \psi \ntwiddle \gamma}{\phi \ntwiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

Either Alice studies or she does not. If, in either case, she will not pass her exams, then it is difficult to comprehend how it might be normal for
her to pass her exams.

The \textit{Disjunctive Rationality} says that a plausible inference made from a disjunction should be plausible from at least one of the disjuncts.

\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Disjunctive Rationality}{\phi \ntwiddle \gamma, \quad \psi \ntwiddle \gamma}{\phi \lor \psi \ntwiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

\textit{Rational monotony} is a much stronger form of restricted monotony than cautious monotony. Where cautious monotony holds the position that we
should only reason monotonically with the addition of new information that was already expected given our beliefs, rational monotony suggests that we
should reason monotonically with the addition of new information if it is merely \textit{consistent} with existing beliefs; that is, we did not
expect the negation of the new information.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Rational Monotony}{\phi \land \psi \ntwiddle \gamma, \quad \phi \ntwiddle \neg \psi }{\phi \ntwiddle \gamma}
\end{align}

Rational monotony can be equivalently stated as the following, which makes the intuition a bit clearer.
\begin{align}
	\inferLeft{Rational Monotony}{\phi \twiddle \psi, \quad \phi \ntwiddle \neg \gamma}{\phi \land \gamma \twiddle \psi}
\end{align}

At a university, it might be normal for students to graduate. At the same time, it would be too great a requirement to suggest that it is normal for
students to be exceptionally clever. It seems completely appropriate to maintain our belief that it is normal for students, who are not exceptionally
clever, to graduate.

Stalnaker \cite{Stalnaker1994,sep-logic-nonmonotonic-Stanford}, and separately Ginsberg \shortcite{GinsberCounterfactuals}, provide an argument
against accepting rational monotony. The objection is that rational monotony commits us to make inferences when the more reasonable position is to
remain undecided. Paraphrasing, we are asked to consider three composers: \textit{Verdi}, who is believed to be Italian, and \textit{Satie} and
\textit{Bizet}, who are believed to be French. If it were learned that Verdi and Bizet were compatriots, then it seems reasonable that the conclusion
that either of them are French or Italian is indeterminate. What is reasonable, however, is to maintain the belief that Satie is French. \footnote{We
	will use some syntax from predicate logic, this is merely an aid to make Stalnaker's example clearer.}
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}

The argument proceeds by considering that Verdi and Satie may too be compatriots. Since Verdi's nationality is now unknown, we are no longer equipped
to reject the plausibility of the new compatriotship, and so

\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\ntwiddle \neg \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie)}
\end{align}

The two conditions of rational monotony have been met, and so the following inference should continue to hold
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\land \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie)}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}

The issue, as Stalnaker sees it, is that rational monotony forces the inference Satie is still French, and by their compatriotship, so are Bizet and
Verdi. The ``correct'' thing to do in this scenario is to remain uncertain about which nationality they all share.

However, the result Stalnaker objects to is dependent his particular construction of this problem, rather than being intrinsic to rational monotony.
The second condition for rational monotony, that $\phi \ntwiddle \neg \gamma$

, makes no requirement about the
syntactic structure of
$\gamma$

outside of it being a formula in the language. In the example, Stalnaker could just as easily have written
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet,Verdi)}\ntwiddle \neg (\neg \texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie))}
\end{align}
meaning that it is not expected that Verdi and Satie are compatriots, to which we can apply an instance of rational monotony, from which we are not
forced to believe that all three composers are French.
\begin{align}
	\texttt{Compatriots(Bizet, Verdi)}\land \neg(\texttt{Compatriots(Verdi,Satie))}\twiddle \texttt{French(Satie)}
\end{align}

There is another objection to rational monotony, which will be considered later on. For now, we accept it as a valid property of non-monotonic
reasoning, and thus introduce \textit{rational relations}.
\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:rational-relation}

	The consequence relation $\twiddle$

	is a \emph{rational consequence relation} if and only if it satisfies the properties of \emph{Reflexivity}, \emph{Left Logical Equivalence},
	\emph{Right Weakening}, \emph{And}, \emph{Or}, \emph{Cautious Monotony}, and \emph{Rational Monotony}.
\end{definition}

Quite evidently, they are a particular kind of preferential relation.

\subsubsection{Ranked Interpretations}
\label{subsubsection:ranked-interpretations}

From the knowledge that rational relations are a particular kind of preferential relation, it seems a reasonable jump to think that the semantics we
give to rational relations may be a particular kind of preferential interpretation. Before discussing this jump, a useful exercise is to recognise
how preferential interpretations may fail to satisfy rational monotony.

Consider the two preferential interpretations shown in \Cref{figure:two-preferential-models}, which model the scenario which was discussed in the
example near the end of the last subsection.

\begin{example}
	\label{example:university}

	Suppose that neither Alice nor Bob is a clever student. In spite of her status, Alice is considered by the preference relation to be a normal
	student, alongside Charlie. This situation is modelled in each of the preferential interpretations below.

	\begin{figure}[H]

			\subcaption{Modular preference relation} \label{subfigure:rational}
		\end{minipage}
		\caption{ Two preferential models of the above scenario} \label{figure:two-preferential-models}
	\end{figure}

	We may verify that both are models of $\texttt{student}\twiddle \texttt{graduate }$ , and neither are models of $\texttt{student}\twiddle
		\texttt{clever}$. By rational monotony, we should expect that $\texttt{student}\land \neg \texttt{clever}\twiddle \texttt{graduate}$ be satisfied,
	which is not the case in \Cref{subfigure:not-rational}.
\end{example}

Fortunately, the culprit is quite easy to spot. Bob, who is not under consideration in the context of normal students, appears when we discuss normal
students who are not clever. In isolation, this seems acceptable: if all the normal students were also clever, then we would be fine accepting the
appearance of a normal, non-clever student who was not a normal student. However, we have explicitly ruled out this line of argument---by the second
antecedent of rational monotony---as Alice is a normal student who is also not clever.

In order to ensure rational monotony, it is required that the preference relation commit to Alice being preferred to Bob; more generally, all normal
students should be explicitly preferred to non-normal students. This notion is formalised by the following property called \textit{modularity}:

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:modular-order}
	\index{partial-order! modular}

	A partial order $\prec$ on the set $X$ is \emph{modular} if and only if for any incomparable $x,y \in X$ when $z \prec x$ then also $z \prec y$.
\end{definition}

One perspective on \textit{modular} partial orders is that they partition the set of states into equivalence classes of preference, so that all
states in the same class are incomparable to one another \cite{GinsberCounterfactuals}. Then, if the preference relation is defined as the
equivalence relation itself, such that one state is preferred to another if the class it belongs to is preferred to the other's, we get a modular
order.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:ranked-interpretation}

	A \emph{ranked interpretation} is a preferential interpretation $\Pin$ where the preference relation $\prec$ is \emph{modular}.
\end{definition}

A somewhat superficial result of ranked interpretations is that they admit a new representation as a stratified equivalence relation, depicted in
\Cref{figure:ranked-interpretation-representation}. Each strata, or \textit{rank}, has an associated ordinal.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:modular-ranking-function}

	If $\prec$ is a modular partial order on $X$ then there is a \emph{ranking function} $\mathsf{r}\colon X \to \Omega$ , with $\Omega$ being a totally
	ordered set for which the strict order is denoted $<$ , such that if $x \prec y$ then $\mathsf{r}(x) < \mathsf{r}(y)$ for any $x,y \in X$ .
\end{lemma}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={circle, fill=black, inner sep=0.5pt, minimum size=1.5mm}]
		\draw[rounded corners=3pt, line width=0.1mm] (0,2) rectangle (4,0);
		\draw[rounded corners=3pt, line width=0.1mm] (0,1) -- (4,1);

		\node[fill=none] (1) at (0.5,1.5) [] {$1$};
		\draw (1,0) -- (1,2);
		\node[fill=none] (alice) at (1.8,0.5) [] {$\{\,c,g,s\,\}$};
		\node[fill=none] (charlie) at (3,0.5) [] {$\{\,g,s\,\}$};

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{A depiction of a ranked interpretation} \label{figure:ranked-interpretation-representation}
\end{figure}

A second, less superficial, departure is that \Cref{lemma:states-preferential} does not hold in the context of ranked interpretations and rational
consequence relations. This follows directly from modularity, as the en passant style arguments, discussed earlier, are avoided by modularity. This
allows the elements which populate the ranks of a ranked interpretation to be valuations directly, rather than states.

\begin{definition}
	\label{definition:ranked-interpretation-real}

	A \emph{ranked interpretation} is a function $\mathsf{r}\colon \mathcal{U}\to \mathbb{N}$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Ranked Entailment}
\label{subsection:ranked-entailment}

\subsection{Rational Closure}
\label{subsection:rational-closure}

Within the context of preferential models, there is another treatment of classical formulae which allows for the discarding of
\Cref{definition:state-satisfaction} and a single notion of what it means for a preferential interpretation to be a model of a formula in $\Lang$.
The idea is to translate the hard-constraints of classical formulae to defeasible syntax.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:classical-to-defeasible}

	If $\phi$ is a classical formula in the language $\Lang$ , then it can be expressed as the defeasible conditional $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$ . Then,
	any preferential interpretation $\pin$ is a model of $\phi$ if and only if it is a model of the defeasible conditional $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$ .
\end{lemma}

To explain the mechanics behind \Cref{lemma:classical-to-defeasible}, consider that a preferential interpretation $\pin$ being a model of the
conditional $\neg \phi \twiddle \bot$ is equivalent to the $\neg \phi$ -minimal states being a subset of the states which satisfy $\bot$ . Of course,
$\bot$ represents logical falshood, and the set of states which satisfy it is the emptyset. In turn, if $\pin$ is a model of $\neg \phi \twiddle
	\bot$ , there can be no states which satisfy $\neg \phi$ , which is equivalent to the condition that all states satisfy $\phi$ . If $\phi$ is thought
of as the proposition \say{All men are mortal}, then the defeasible counterpart reads as \say{If not all men are mortal, then it is normal to infer
	anything, including a contradiction} \cite{kraus1990nonmonotonic,lehmann1992what}. We assume this treatment of classical formulae from this point
onwards, and consolidate the notation as $\pin \VDash \phi$ where $\phi \in \Lang$ is a defeasible conditional. \textcolor{red}{maybe something about
